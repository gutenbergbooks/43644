<h2>FOREWORD.</h2>


<p>That fantastic life at G.H.Q., so greatly
detached from the normal&mdash;the life of the men
whose words had power to send Armies into and
out of action, to give this Division rest and
surcease from the agony of the struggle, to
assign to that Division the stress of a new effort;
the men into whose hands the nation poured
millions without stint and at whose call the
whole world moved to spin or dig or forge&mdash;will
it be of interest now to recall some of its
memories, to attempt an intimate picture of its
routine?</p>

<p>Fantastic the life was truly. One man of
imagination, who had done his work in the line
so well as to win a reputation for great courage
and administrative ability, and had carried
through with a quiet skill and a simple dutifulness
the responsibilities of the "small family"
of a regiment, found, when he was transferred
to G.H.Q., that the sense of responsibility was
too great for his temperament. He was not a
very important cog of the machine. But the
feeling that the motion which his hand started
set going so great a series of actions got on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
nerves to the extent that he could neither sleep
nor eat with comfort, nor decide the simplest
matter without torturing doubt as to whether
it were right or wrong. He "moved on"
within a few days.</p>

<p>Fortunately that sense of vision was rare.
The average man was content to "carry on"
with his task with what good judgment Heaven
gave him, deciding as the established routine,
or the common-sense shift of a new emergency,
dictated.</p>

<p>But looking back, reflecting on all the woeful
results that might have sprung from a careless
blunder, from too great haste, from too
deliberate hesitation, from over fear or over
confidence, it is to be seen how fantastic, how
abnormal was the life centred in that little
walled town of Montreuil, the focus of a
spider's web of wires, at one end of which were
the soldiers in their trenches, at the other the
workers of the world at their benches. Yet we
ate, drank, slept, played a little and talked,
very much as if we were workers in some
commercial house, directing coffee from a
plantation to a warehouse and then to a
breakfast table, instead of dealing in blood and
tears, drawing without stint on human life and
human hope so that the idea of Right and
Liberty might be saved in the world.</p>

<p>It is well that Imagination went to sleep, or
was lacking. For so the work could be done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
and the war directed to its safe conclusion.
But a record of the life we lived seems now, in
retrospect, almost indecorous. It is as if
we should not have munched food, talked
trivialities, while before our eyes and under our
hands was played out the greatest tragedy Man
has known; as if it would have been more fitting
if we had gone from uneasy couches, tight-lipped
and anxious, to our desks, haunted
always by a sense of doom.</p>

<p>It was not like that. And, such as it was,
I attempt to record it&mdash;a serious enough life in
any sense of the word, monkish in its denial of
some pleasures, rigid in discipline, exacting in
work, but neither austere nor anxious&mdash;such a
life as studious boys might live in a Public
School, if there can be imagined a Public School
in which sport was reduced to the minimum
essential to keep one fit for hard "swotting."
But a life with some relaxations, and some
pleasures, cheerful, actually light-hearted.</p>

<p>Questions of the conduct of the war must
obtrude somewhat in this book, but it will be
only in so much as they are a necessary background
to the story of the life of G.H.Q.&mdash;of
G.H.Q. in its later phase when it had moved
from St. Omer to Montreuil and had become
what it was in the final result, a capable Board
of Directors of as glorious a company of soldiers
as the world has known. There will be no
attempt at a history of the war, no battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
pictures, which are usually vain efforts to
measure the immeasurable. Yet it is hoped
that the reader will get from it some idea of the
character and the complexities of the struggle.</p>

<p>Already fogs of controversy are obscuring
many of the facts of the war. There is a
controversy whether the first Commander-in-Chief
should have been recalled when he was;
about the merits of the second Commander-in-Chief;
about the "unity of command"
decision; about the relative merits of a strategy
which would concentrate everything for a
supreme effort in France and a strategy which
would seek a "back door" to the German
citadel; about the actual cause and duration of
the shell shortage. In accordance with our
British custom we are mostly taking sides,
following some leader and putting our faith in
his views, and all his views, implicitly. Thus
are formed parties. I claim with honesty, and
perhaps with correctness, not to belong to
any of the parties. I have set down these
observations on G.H.Q. without a thought of
whether they may support this view or that view
on the conduct of the war.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h4>BEFORE G.H.Q. WENT TO MONTREUIL.</h4>

<h4>The first stages of the War&mdash;"Trench War,"
a good German invention&mdash;The Battle of Eyes&mdash;Waiting
for the Big Push&mdash;The Loos disappointment&mdash;Moving
G.H.Q. to Montreuil.</h4>


<p>It was the task of General Headquarters
to try to see the War as a whole, to obtain a
knowledge not only of the strictly military
situation but, to an extent, also of the moral
and the political situation of the enemy and
of our own forces. In the later stages of the
campaign that task was being done, <i>pace</i> all
the critics, with an efficiency that was
wonderful, seeing that before the Great War
the British nation did not allow its Army any
chance at all of war practice on a big scale.
Our Generals, whatever skill they might have
won in studying the theory of war, had had no
opportunity to practise big movements. They
were very much in the position of men trained
in the running of a small provincial store who
were asked suddenly to undertake the conduct
of one of the mammoth "universal providers."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>It is of G.H.Q. in the later stages of the war
that I write, not G.H.Q. of the earlier stages,
when our Army was finding its feet. But a
slight generalisation regarding those earlier
stages is necessary to an understanding of the
subsequent growth of the Army organisation
and of its Board of Directors at G.H.Q.</p>

<p>The small Army which crossed to France
in 1914 was organised as an Expeditionary
Force for a war of movement. It did gallant
work in the first phase, as all have admitted.
When the war of movement stopped and the
struggle settled down to the War of the
Trenches, though that gave a good opportunity
of recruiting, it brought up an entirely new
set of problems, for which our organisation had
made no provision at all and in which British
natural gifts did not have the best chance of
display. Indeed our training system at home
refused in 1914-15 to "recognise" Trench
War. The New Armies were trained on the
same lines as the old Regular Army, but of
course more hurriedly, more intensively, less
efficiently. They learned Trench Warfare&mdash;an
almost entirely different game&mdash;when they got
out to the Front. A reversal of the process&mdash;to
have taught the much simpler Trench Warfare
in the home camps and left the teaching of
movement warfare to training intervals in
France&mdash;was an obviously more economical
system, and it was that adopted at a later stage.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>When a considered history of the war comes
to be written, probably it will give to the
German High Command high praise for this
period of "Trench War." It was the one
conspicuously good invention of the enemy. It
enabled him almost completely to stop the war
in the one theatre where he had to meet troops
superior to his own, whilst his forces ranged
round Europe winning cheap victories
and finally (though too late as it proved)
vanquishing opposition elsewhere. There is no
doubt that the Trench War device baffled our
side for a time. I like the story of Marshal
Joffre explaining the position to an American
war correspondent and adding:</p>

<p>"You see there is nothing to be done."</p>

<p>"No. I suppose nobody could do anything?"</p>

<p>"Nobody."</p>

<p>"Not even Napoleon?"</p>

<p>But Marshal Joffre paused at that, and after
a moment's reflection said:</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose Napoleon could do something."</p>

<p>Finally the "something" came in the shape
of the "Tank."</p>

<p>When Field Marshal Earl Haig took over the
chief command he adopted the system of
frequent "raids" to give to the Trench War
some of the character of moving war, and that
proved a highly useful step. Still, this Trench
War was not of the genius of our people; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
it was very dull. If I were seeking the fit
adjective which could be applied to it in
its superlative it would certainly not be
"exciting" nor yet "dangerous." The life
was exciting and it was dangerous&mdash;a little. It
was, however, neither very exciting nor very
dangerous. But it was very, very curious.
Trench war had its moments, its hours of high
emotion, of intense excitement, of crowding
dangers. Its routine&mdash;on the Western front&mdash;was
laborious, almost to the point of
tediousness, demanding a sober and constant
carefulness in detail, and&mdash;provided you
watched the minutes and the winds, the twigs
and the sky, had eyes, ears, and nerves always
on the alert&mdash;it was reasonably safe.</p>

<p>Trench War exciting? No; you could not
allow it to be. The moments were rare (to the
majority of officers they never came) when the
call was for a gallant shout and a forward rush
in which leadership took its most obvious and
its easiest form. The hours were always when,
with cool, suspicious, deducting mind, you were
watching a sector, awaiting the enemy's raiding
attack or directing your own. Stalking and
being stalked, it was interesting, absorbing, but
you could not allow it to be exciting, or you
would not do your work properly. War was
robbed, in that phase of the struggle, of most of
its fascinations by the spectacled Germans who
had spent the previous half-century in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
counting house, the laboratory, and the cellar,
preparing to destroy the humanities of civilisation.
Trench War was a grubbing kind of
business.</p>

<p>Dangerous? Naturally, to an extent. But
not nearly so dangerous as one might judge from
the lurid accounts of imaginative writers. It
had its hours of peril, of horror. But it was
not all the time dangerous. For six days out of
seven, on an average, a soldier, if he observed
the strictest caution, was "following a
dangerous trade," nothing more. On the
seventh day&mdash;I speak in averages&mdash;he had his
risk about doubled. On very rare occasions he
had to take the risk of a fireman who goes
into a blazing house to rescue a child, or a
policeman who stops a madly bolting horse.
Ordinarily one had to be careful "to watch the
traffic;" that was all. If you wished to take a
long lingering look at the enemy's trench you
used a periscope. For a brief glance (to get a
wide field of view) you looked over the parapet.
There were differing estimates of the length of
time it was safe to show your head over the
parapet. Some said five seconds, others twenty-five.</p>

<p>"The German is slow in the up-take,"
remarked the officer who insisted that twenty-five
seconds was quite a safe time to look over
the parapet.</p>

<p>Behind the parapet it was almost as safe&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
on dry days as pleasant&mdash;as on a marine
parade. A solid fortification of sandbags,
proof against any blow except that of a big
high-explosive shell, enclosed on each side a
walk, drained, paved, lined with dug-outs, in
places adorned with little flower beds. I write,
of course, of the Trench War in its "settled"
stage&mdash;not of those grim struggles around
Ypres in the Autumn of 1914.</p>

<p>Not exciting, not as dangerous as one would
imagine, the Trench War was more curious,
more "uncanny," than it is possible to
describe. Try to imagine the huge ditch, some
300 miles long, from the North Sea to the Swiss
lakes, which was our trench, facing another
ditch which was their trench, all lined with
Eyes, thousands, millions of Eyes. All day,
all night, these Eyes stare and stare. At night
the hands serving them break up the dark with
star shells, and the brains behind them welcome
the day, only because it makes the scrutiny of
Death more easy. On the front edge of each
ditch the Eyes are thick in line; farther back, in
every possible post of observation, are groups of
Eyes, and Eyes soar up into the air now and
again to stare into the secrets concealed on
the other side. There are Eyes of infantry,
Eyes of artillery, Eyes of airmen. The scrutiny
never pauses for an instant. Let an Eye blink
a moment and it may mean catastrophe, a
stealthy rush on a trench or a flood of poisoning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
gas. The great dark gutter stretching across
Belgium and France was fringed with staring
Eyes; and every Eye had to record its message
to G.H.Q.</p>

<p>Carefulness, tedious, monotonous carefulness,
absolute punctuality, and grave attention to
every detail&mdash;these were the warrior qualities
in the Trench War period. The minutes had
to be watched, the grass watched lest you trod
down a path and gave away some secret to the
Eyes yonder. All the minute details of life
were hedged in with precautions and penalties.</p>

<p>This tedious Trench War was not the game
for British blood, though on the whole it was
done well, especially after Loos when the
raiding policy was instituted. But it was
tedious; and very clearly it was impossible to
win while it lasted. For victory the Germans
had to be turned out of those trenches. So,
during the tedium of the Trench War we would
comfort ourselves with the thought that very
soon the Big Push must come. Often the most
definite news came that it was fixed for the next
month. This very definite news was usually
traced back to some signaller who had overheard
something on the telephone. Perhaps Divisional
H.Q. had a Member of Parliament (doing a
"Cook's tour" of the Front) to dinner and
peremptory messages were going down to the
Coast asking for lobsters to be sent up. Now
a guileless signaller would never imagine that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Generals and the like were interested in lobster.
If he thought of their diet at all he probably
imagined they lived on trench maps&mdash;of which
the consumption was certainly huge. Thus the
signaller, hearing strange peremptory messages
about lobsters, might conclude that this was
some very secret code, and, the Big Push being
in all our thoughts, that it would have reference
to that most certainly. But for many months
it was not the Big Push; it was only the
lobster, which was the standard of gaiety and
dissipation at a Mess Dinner.</p>

<p>At the time of the Loos attack it did really
seem that the Big Push had come. But we were
disappointed. Perhaps at the Front we were
as impatient at the result as the people at home,
but we could soothe our impatience with the
thought of the greatness of the technical
difficulties of arranging an advance with a
battle-line hundreds of miles in length, all
entrenched (difficulties which did not occur to
those gentlemen who wrote weekly expert
articles, to show how it should be done). It was
clear that if we could push forward a little
at certain vital points, a rich reward would
be reaped. We knew that what would seem the
obvious thing&mdash;to press along the whole line and
break through in the weak parts&mdash;would have
only landed us in a number of advanced salients
which would be hard, or impossible, to defend
when they came under enfilade fire. There were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
scores of places in which the German would
willingly have let us through; to destroy the
advanced party afterwards. We had to aim
to push in wedges at our own selected points
where the salient thus formed could be defended
and could seriously threaten a German line of
communication. It was not easy, for the
number of those points was limited and the
German knew them all.</p>

<p>Loos showed very plainly what we were "up
against." There was a long pause for further
preparation, a pause which seemed unendurably
long at the time when the French were taking
such a hammering at Verdun and we were going
on with tedious Trench War and still more
tedious preparations behind the lines.</p>

<p>Criticism of the British military effort at this
stage of the war was fairly general and sometimes
very hostile. Some assumed that we had
tried our last blow at Loos and that we would
never do more than hold a trench sector until the
French could finish the war. At Home there
were critics who argued that the British
military effort would have been more wisely
directed if, in the first stage of the war, the
British Expeditionary Force had been kept at
home and used as the nucleus for training a
great continental army, ignoring the pressing
circumstances of August, 1914.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly in that way a great British
Army could have been far more quickly raised.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Undoubtedly, too, the task of forming the new
British Army was very seriously handicapped
by the draining away to France of practically
all the fully-trained men of military age in
Great Britain. But with a choice of two
courses Great Britain took the more daring and
the more generous one; and that in human
affairs is generally the better one. The material
help which the Five Divisions of the British
Army gave to the French was not negligible.
The moral help was much greater. The lack of
those Divisions might have lost Paris to the
French and left the Germans in control of all
France north and east of the Seine; and that
event might have ended the war&mdash;it would
certainly have prejudiced seriously the French
recovery.</p>

<p>The risk taken by Great Britain in stripping
her own territory of its only efficient army was
not inconsiderable. Direct attack by Germany
was seriously feared then. A bolder German
naval policy, indeed, might have secured an
invasion of England. Plans were drawn up
in England at one time on the supposition of a
German descent on our coasts being successful
in its first stages, and it was proposed to meet
this by converting a wide coastal section of
England into a desert.</p>

<p>Criticism was to be silenced in time, for
presently we were to open that giant battle
which was not to finish until November, 1918,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and which was then to finish with the British
Army the most important force in the Field.</p>

<p>G.H.Q. moved to Montreuil on March 31st,
1916. On the same date, it may be said, the
British Army in France came to man's estate.
It had been up to this an "auxiliary army"
holding a small section of the front, and a
"training army" getting ready to take over&mdash;as
ultimately it did take over&mdash;the main
burden of the war; for, counting its captures
of prisoners and guns from August, 1918, to
November 11th, 1918, the British Army's share
in the final victory was almost equal to that of
the French, American and Belgian forces
combined.</p>

<p>G.H.Q. came to Montreuil because St. Omer,
the old G.H.Q. town, was no longer suitable as
the centre for the vast operations pending. It
had served well enough when we formed the left
wing of the French battle line. Now we were
to be the spear-head of the thrust against
Germany.</p>

<p>Look back upon the little British Army of at
first four and then five Divisions, which in 1914
took rank alongside the French by Mons, and
fell back fighting until the rally of the Marne;
and then upon the Army of 1916 of ten
times the strength, which was directed from
Montreuil. The growth shows as marvellous,
and especially so to those who understand how
an army in the field is comparable to an iceberg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
at sea, of which the greater part is unseen.
For every rifleman in the trenches and gunner in
the gun-pits there are at least three other people
working to keep him supplied with food,
clothing, ammunition, and on communications.
So an Army's growth demands a growth behind
the line three times as great as that in the line.
And this growth is not merely a matter of the
multiplication of riflemen and gunners and
auxiliaries, a heaping up of men. It must be
an organic growth to be effective at all; an
adding one by one of highly complex and yet
homogeneous units.</p>

<p>A "Division" is the integral unit of any
Army, and a Division must have in the
field its infantry battalions, cavalry or cyclist
companies, field batteries, signallers (with
"wireless," telephone and telegraph service),
engineers, transport and supply services,
medical and ambulance services. All told, it
numbered about 17,000 officers and men at the
close of the war, but in 1914 the strength of a
Division was nearer to 20,000. And this body
of 20,000 was not a mob, nor a crowd, nor yet
even a simple organization such as a band of
factory employees. It was a nation in
microcosm, its constituent numbers covering
almost the whole of the activities of life. It
had to be organised to fight, to keep up communications,
to manufacture and repair, to
feed itself and its horses, to keep good health<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
conditions in its camps and to succour its sick
and wounded. Besides fighting men it had
doctors, vets., sanitary engineers, mechanics of
all kinds, chemists, electricians. Behind the
line the Division's supports, its munition and
clothing factories, its food providers, had to
be organised just as carefully.</p>

<p>Nothing can be made without making
mistakes, and in the carrying out of this giant
task of making the Army of the British Empire
there were many mistakes of detail. It is in
the nature of the human mind to see such
mistakes in high relief, as the human eye sees
small patches of stone stand out from a vast
field of snow. But, making the worst that can
be made of the mistakes, if they are seen in
proper perspective they cannot blur the
dazzling brilliance of a marvellous achievement.</p>

<p>Most of the mistakes, moreover, were direct
consequences of that innocence of warlike
intention and that passion for human right and
liberty which was common to Great Britain
as to the rest of Western Europe, and on which,
clearly, the German Powers had counted as
sufficient to paralyse effective resistance to
their deliberate and designed preparation.
Hindering those good qualities of peacefulness
proved to be, but not paralysing. After all,
the task was done. That most dangerous first
rush of German militarism was stayed. The
powerful beast was kept within bounds whilst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
weapons were forged for his destruction. In
vain were all his efforts, backed by the skill of
half a century of preparation and Spartan
discipline.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Montreuil was chosen as G.H.Q. for a wide
variety of reasons. It was on a main road
from London to Paris&mdash;the two chief centres of
the campaign&mdash;though not on a main railway
line, which would have been an inconvenience.
It was not an industrial town and so avoided
the complications alike of noise and of a
possibly troublesome civil population.<ins class="fnanchor" title="The population of Montreuil in 1906 was 2,883.">[1]</ins> It was
from a telephone and motor transit point of
view in a very central situation to serve the
needs of a Force which was based on Dunkirk,
Calais, Boulogne, Dieppe, and Havre, and had
its front stretching from the Somme to beyond
the Belgian frontier.</p>

<p>A great general, asked to define in a phrase
what was wanted for a Headquarters, said "A
central remoteness." It was urged that this
seemed an oxymoron. "Well then, if you like,
a remote centrality." The finality of that
allowed of no further argument. Montreuil
provided both a central position and a position
remote from the disturbances and distractions
of traffic, of a large population, of gay social
interests. The great Ecole Militaire offered
accommodation for the chief offices. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
was sufficient billeting accommodation in the
town houses and the neighbouring chateaux.</p>

<span class="caption">THE 'CAVÉE' SAINT FIRMIN</span>
</div>

<p>G.H.Q. of course was never a great camp.
Its total military population was never more
than 5,000, including those G.H.Q. troops who
were needed for guards and who were drawn
first from the Artists' Rifles, then from the
Honourable Artillery Company, then from the
Newfoundland Regiment, and finally from the
Guernsey Regiment. Accommodation at
Montreuil was reinforced somewhat by hutments
in 1917-18, but on the whole the town was
big enough for its purpose.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h4>MONTREUIL AND THE MONTREUILLOIS.</h4>

<h4>How the Montreuillois once learned to hate the
English&mdash;Early history of the famous town&mdash;Its
link with the early Roman-British Empire&mdash;A
border town in the Anglo-French Wars&mdash;When
G.H.Q. was bombed.</h4>


<p>Military convenience alone dictated the
choice of Montreuil as the site of the General
Headquarters of the British Expeditionary
Force in France as soon as that Force reached
to such a strength as to take its full share in
the campaign. But the choice might well have
been influenced by a sentimental desire to make
this town, which was so intimately associated
with the old enmity between England and
France, the centre of the Great Reconciliation.
Montreuil and the Montreuillois for many
centuries cordially hated England, and not
without good reason. In April, 1369, they
chased the English from the town with hoots of
"<i>A la queue, à la queue les Anglais.</i>" After
550 years, in April, 1919, they saw the British
G.H.Q. leave Montreuil with what different
feelings!</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Very curious is the way in which Montreuil
has been linked up with Anglo-French history.
In the days of the Roman occupation of Gaul
the Roman Empire had a naval station close to,
or actually on, the great fortress rock which
guarded the mouth of the Canche and which
was then a peninsula jutting out into the sea.
This station, no doubt, Julius Cæsar used in his
expedition against Britain. Later Carausius,
a Roman Briton, revolted against the Roman
Empire and, by winning the command of the
Channel with his Fleet, maintained for a time
an independent Britain. He assumed the state
of Cæsar and founded a Roman-British
Empire. The <i>Classis Britannica</i> of the Roman
Empire had had its chief station at or near
Montreuil. With the revolt of Carausius there
was no longer a "British Fleet" of the Roman
Empire, and the <i>Classis Samarica</i> (the Fleet of
the Somme) was organised to hold the coasts of
Gaul for the Roman Power against the British
rebel, Carausius. This Fleet of the Somme had
a station on the Canche, at or near Montreuil.
Doubtless in those very early years of the
Christian era there was many a naval action
between the British sea forces and those of the
Romans stationed on the Canche.</p>

<p>Of any actual Roman buildings on the hill of
Montreuil there exists to-day no trace. But it
may be accepted as certain that the Gauls had
fortified this great hill at the mouth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Canche and that the Roman Conquerors did not
neglect its strategical advantages. It is well
within the bounds of the historic imagination to
picture Carausius, the man who first taught
England that her fate depended on the holding
of the Narrow Seas, looking with vain
hostility on a well-fortified Roman naval
station at Montreuil which often sent harassing
expeditions against his coast. In later years
of Anglo-French enmity Montreuil was
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Montrueil-sur-mer'">Montreuil-sur-mer</ins> only in name, for the sea had
retreated ten miles, and Etaples was the port at
the mouth of the Canche; but in the Roman
days and for some centuries after, Montreuil
was a good harbour for trade or for war.</p>

<p>When the barbarian invasions overwhelmed
the Roman Empire, Montreuil disappeared from
history until the Seventh Century, when the
monk St. Saulve (subsequently Bishop of
Amiens) built a monastery on the great hill.
From this monastery, without much doubt, the
name of Montreuil comes; for in all old French
manuscripts it is spelt "Monstereul," which
is an easy step from "Monasteriolum," "the
place of the monastery." In St. Saulve's day
Montreuil appears to have been a bold
promontory at the edge of the sea, with the
River Canche running close to its base and a
thriving village at its foot. According to some
accounts, St. Saulve's first monastery was built
on the ruins of an earlier castle; if so it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
probably have been a castle of Roman origin.</p>

<p>Montreuil became a famous shrine, and
reports came from it of many miracles. The
Saints Omer, Riquier, Bertin and Josse, whose
names are kept on record in St. Omer and other
neighbouring towns and villages, were monks
of the Montreuil monastery. There is a Forest
of Josse just near Montreuil, and I regret to
say that some American officers were persuaded
to believe that it got its name from being the
site of a Chinese Labour Joss-house, to the
lessening of the glory of St. Josse.</p>

<p>With the ravages of the pirate Northmen
another period of darkness falls upon the town
of Montreuil until the 9th century, when the
famous Count Hildgood (that is to say "hold-good,"
a stubborn man in the fight) resolved to
make head against the Northmen, and in
defence of his county of Ponthieu built on
Montreuil Hill a strong fortress. Traces of
this fortress still exist in the town. The Hotel
de France (which was a meeting place for
officers of G.H.Q. when a dinner away from
Mess formalities was desired) stands on part of
the site of "Hold-good's" fortress.</p>

<p>Count Hildgood was something of a statesman
as well as a soldier, and encouraged a
civilian population to collect at the foot of his
fortress, and used the glory of St. Saulve's
monastery to attract to the place other religious
communities from Brittany and elsewhere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Montreuil became thus a famous strong-point.
It developed on the familiar lines of a mediæval
city with its well-established local rights, those
of "the peers of the peerage of Montreuil."
The ravages of the Northmen in the surrounding
country continued, but Montreuil was too strong
for them and grew into a city of refuge, giving
hospitality to many religious refugee communities
even from as far away as Brittany.</p>

<p>It remained without dispute a part of the
county of Ponthieu until 939, when, as related
by the monkish historian Richer, it was coveted
by the Count of Flanders and captured through
the treachery of the governor, Robert le
Chepier. (One of the towers of the existing
fortifications still bears his name). The
children of the Count of Ponthieu were taken
captives and sent to the English Court to be held
as prisoners&mdash;giving rise to one of the first of
the many grudges that the good Montreuillois
had against England. The Count of Ponthieu
appealed for help to the then Duke of
Normandy (William of the Long Sword). The
help was given, Montreuil was wrested from
the Flemings, and handed back to the Count of
Ponthieu according to some accounts, held by
the Normans according to other accounts, which
have a greater air of reasonableness, for the
Normans were good at taking and slow at giving
back.</p>

</div>

<p>But all disputes as to the possession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Montreuil between the Counts of Ponthieu and
Flanders and the Duke of Normandy were
settled by the King of France, Hugo Capet,
who made the town part of the Royal Domain of
France and built a great fortified château by the
side of the old citadel. A part of this château
still remains, "the Tower of Queen Bertha,"
so-called from the unhappy fate of Bertha,
Queen of Philip I. of France. She was the
daughter of the Count Florent I. of Holland,
and had borne Philip three children when he
became enamoured of the wife of the Count of
Anjou and shut his own wife up to die in
Montreuil. To quote the old chronicle: "Il
la mist en prison en un fort chastel qui a nom
Monstereul-sur-la-mer." The poor lady seems
to have been most harshly treated, and was left
dependent on the charity of the townsfolk for
her food. The children of Montreuil recall the
story to this day when begging for money for
the churches with the cry "Give, give, to your
Queen."</p>

<p>By this time the Norman Conquest had given
England a place in European politics. The
13th Century brought Montreuil under the
English Crown. Jeanne, Countess of Ponthieu
and Montreuil, had married the King of
Castille and Leon. Their daughter Eleonora
of Castille married Edward I., King of
England, and part of her dowry was Montreuil.
Edward I. came over in 1279 to take over his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
new possession, and promised the Montreuillois
to safeguard all their local rights and
privileges. But the good folk of the town did
not like the English of that day, and disputes
were constant. They rejoiced when war broke
out between France and England (a war in
which the French had the Scots as allies and
the English the Flemings); for the King of
France exempted Montreuil from her feudal
duty to the English King.</p>

<p>That war was stopped by the intervention
of Pope Boniface, and a Peace Conference
assembled at Montreuil. One of the peace
conditions was that the Prince of Wales should
marry the daughter of the King of France, and
this marriage was celebrated with great
magnificence at Boulogne, the young princess
passing through Montreuil to the wedding.
She received as her pin-money from her husband
the revenues of Ponthieu and Montreuil.</p>

<p>But that marriage did not make for peace.
On the contrary its fruits were a new series of
wars interrupted by an occasional truce or
brief peace. Crécy and Agincourt were both
fought almost in sight of Montreuil. The
district round was ravaged again and again
by the English forces, and several times the
town itself was besieged in vain. After Crécy,
Edward tried to take it and failed. An
incident of one of the peace treaties was the
visit of Chaucer, the poet, to Montreuil as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
English plenipotentiary. An incident of one
of the wars was the passage through Montreuil
of the funeral procession of King Henry V.</p>

<p>So through the years Montreuil was in the
very heart of the struggle between English and
French. It was in a manner the border town
between the territory in France which was
admitted to be English, and the disputed
territory. Thus it learned a deep hatred of
the English. Often as a condition of peace it
was handed over to English domination; never
was it content with that destiny. Finally, the
ambition of the English Kings to add France
to their realms&mdash;an ambition which was as bad
for England as it was for France&mdash;was
definitely frustrated. Montreuil, passionately
French in spirit, "the most faithful town in all
Picardy," as Henry of Navarre called it, was
no more to be vexed either by English governors
or English marauders.</p>

<p>But Montreuil cherished its dislike of the
English, and probably had never been so happy
for centuries as when in 1804 it was the headquarters
of the left wing of Napoleon's Army
for the invasion of England. General Ney was
the officer in command at Montreuil, and his
brilliant receptions brought back to the town
some of its Middle Ages pomp. It was from
Montreuil that in 1804 General Ney addressed
to Napoleon a memorial begging him to take
the Imperial Crown for the sake of France.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Napoleon himself visited Montreuil more than
once, and a house in which he slept is still shown
in the Place Verte.</p>

<p>Little or nothing of this was in the minds of
our Staff in deciding upon Montreuil as a site
for G.H.Q. It was convenient (as its choice
in old times for Peace Conferences between
England and France clearly shows) to London
and to Paris. It was off any main traffic route,
and promised quiet for telephone services.
The feelings of the inhabitants were presumed
to be friendly, and the presumption was
justified, though curiously enough there was in
1918 a slight revival of the old anti-English
feelings, and I even heard whispered again
"<i>à la queue les Anglais</i>." It all arose from
what must be admitted to have been rather an
undignified incident.</p>

<p>There used to be a fable&mdash;no one was fonder
of giving it circulation than the Red Tabs&mdash;that
there was a mutual agreement between the
Germans and ourselves that G.H.Q. on both
sides was to be spared from air raids.</p>

<p>"The arrangement is a classic instance of
our stupidity," the Red Tab humorist would
remark, "for the German scores both ways."</p>

<p>"How is that?"</p>

<p>"Well, his Staff is spared, which is valuable
to him. And our Staff is spared, which is also
valuable to him."</p>

<p>Staff officers, B.E.F., could afford to pass on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
gibes like that in 1917-18 when British Staff
work was the model which the new American
armies set themselves to imitate.</p>

<p>But as a matter of fact in the summer of
1918 G.H.Q. was bombed pretty regularly by
the enemy. Those who lived there had unhappy
proof of that. There were several deaths from
bombs in and near the town. After the first
bombing attacks orders were issued that no
soldier, except sentries and officers on night
duty, was to be allowed to sleep in Montreuil.
The whole garrison was to go into the woods at
night, or to take refuge in the deep dug-outs
which were tunnelled under the city. Hardly a
night passed without a bombing raid, until the
tide of battle turned and the German bomber
had neither heart nor means for nocturnal
wanderings.</p>

<p>There was no doubt that a good motive
inspired the orders for the nightly evacuation
of the town by officers and soldiers except those
actually on duty. It was thought that the
Germans had discovered G.H.Q. and had
resolved one night to "wipe it out." A really
determined raid concentrated on a small walled
town might have effected that. But the nightly
march out of the troops did not impress
favourably the inhabitants, who mostly had to
stay. Some of them openly jeered; others made
less parade of their feelings, but had them all
the same.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where are the English?"</p>

<p>"The English are in the woods of Wailly."</p>

<p>That was a favourite street-corner gibe.</p>

<p>Most officers who did not get direct orders to
leave the town of nights kept to their billets,
but all the rank and file were marched out, or
rather driven out by motor lorries. The
Officers' Club closed early of evenings so that
the Q.M.A.A.C.s might be evacuated to a
camp outside the town. At this camp they
evidently did not have the same conveniences
as in the town for dressing their hair and so on;
and they had to start off very early in the
morning to be in time to wait at breakfast.
Tempers as well as coiffures were a little ragged
in consequence.</p>

<span class="caption">THE MARKET</span>
</div>

<p>One advantage that we won from the bomb
'scare' (if that word is justified) was that it
gave a stimulus to archæological research in the
town. There was at G.H.Q. at the time, as a
Major, R.E., that fine "sport" Professor
David of Sydney University. Professor David
has a great celebrity as a geologist. His birth
year was 1858, so he is not exactly a youngster
except in heart. But the spirit of adventure
and patriotism which sent him out to the South
Pole with the Shackleton Expedition in 1907-1909
sent him from Australia to this war. He
did useful work with an Australian Tunnelling
Company in connection with the famous
Messines mine, and his knowledge as a geologist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
was afterwards of great use to G.H.Q. in
matters of mines, of water supply, and the like.
Now he was asked to take in hand the task of
providing good under-ground dug-outs for the
Montreuil garrison. His researches disclosed
some very interesting old galleries or quarries
under the citadel. Passages were cut through
to these from points in the Ramparts, and I
believe that even the good citizens of Montreuil
did not disdain to take advantage of the
English "dug-outs" when the German bombs
began to fall.</p>

<p>All the same, when that nightly march
out of the town was dropped we were
all very glad; and our relations with the
townspeople were restored to their old
serenity.</p>

<p>At the worst the hostile section was not a very
large one. Many officers who were at G.H.Q.
have memories of warm personal friendships
with some of the French residents, who did all
that was in their power to make them feel that
France was a second home. At one residence
(where I was billetted for a time, that of M.
Laurent and his wife) the lady had established
a homely little <i>salon</i>, which was quite a student's
centre not only for officers but for other ranks.
Mme. Laurent spoke English well, and it was
her hobby to teach French to any willing pupil
of the British Army and to interest soldiers in
the history of the old town. There were many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
others who took the same kindly interest in our
mental welfare.</p>

<p>The good Montreuillois of 1919 certainly did
not hate the English as their ancestors had
done. They considered that the five years since
1914 had washed out all old injuries.<a href="#appendix"><ins class="fnanchor" title="See Appendix.">[2]</ins></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h4>G.H.Q. AT WORK.</h4>

<h4>The Functions of G.H.Q.&mdash;The varying conditions
to be met&mdash;The working hours&mdash;The
organisation of a branch&mdash;The Chief's system.</h4>


<p>To the very end of the war, no doubt, an
occasional young regimental officer could be
found who knew exactly what G.H.Q. did:
"They swanked about in Red Tabs and cars:
had a gorgeous 'mike,' and, to keep up a show
of work, issued all kinds of fool orders which
nobody in the trenches had any time to read."</p>

<p>This theory of the functions of G.H.Q. had
quite a vogue in "regimental circles" at one
time. It was not, of course, founded on any
mental process or it would be deeply interesting
to investigate how these gentlemen came to
think that ammunition and supplies could
arrive fortuitously, that a concentration of
troops or of Tanks could "just happen."</p>

<span class="caption">LIEUT-GENERAL THE HON. SIR H. A. LAWRENCE<br />
(Chief of the General Staff)</span>
</div>

<p>But, apart from that sort of thoughtless talk,
there was, even among senior officers, some lack
of knowledge as to what exactly the hermits of
Montreuil did. They knew of them as issuing
General Routine Orders in the name of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Commander-in-Chief (some 5,000 of these
G.R.O.s were issued in the course of the war);
as circulating, more privately, secret orders and
instructions, and perhaps of making occasional
appearances on the battle-field, though probably
the majority of regimental officers never saw a
G.H.Q. officer. In brief summary, the more
important functions of G.H.Q. were:</p>

  <blockquote><p>1. G.H.Q. was the link between the B.E.F.
  and the British Government. The War
  Cabinet sitting in London was the supreme
  authority. The Secretary of State for
  War was its spokesman and, with the War
  Office Staff, its adviser. The Commander-in-Chief
  was the Army's spokesman and,
  with his G.H.Q., the negotiator with the
  Secretary of State for War. In the final
  result the B.E.F. had to do what it was
  ordered to do by the Secretary of State, but
  the Commander-in-Chief was usually consulted
  beforehand, and had always the
  right of discussion and of remonstrance.
  The relations between the Home Government
  and the Army were recognised as the
  most important matter dealt with by
  G.H.Q., and War Office letters had a
  special priority. No one except the Commander-in-Chief
  communicated directly
  with the War Office.</p>

  <p>2. G.H.Q. was the link between the British
  Army in the Field and the Allied armies&mdash;the French,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
  American, Belgian and
  Portuguese. Relations between these were
  maintained through Military Missions, we
  keeping a Mission with the G.H.Q. of the
  Allied Army, they keeping Missions with
  our G.H.Q. There was, quite apart from
  big questions of operations, discussion of
  which was confined to the Chief of the
  General Staff and the heads of the foreign
  Missions, an immense amount of technical
  transport, supply and finance work between
  the Allies. There was hardly an officer of
  G.H.Q. who did not in some detail
  come into relations with the foreign
  Missions.</p>

  <p>3. G.H.Q. had to decide the strategy of the
  campaign in its relation to the British
  sector. After the unity of Command there
  was a somewhat lessened responsibility in
  this matter, but the work was practically
  the same. The Commander-in-Chief, in
  consultation with his Chief of Staff, his
  Quartermaster-General and his Adjutant-General,
  decided when and with what
  forces we should attack, when adopt a
  defensive policy. To come to those decisions
  a close and constant study was necessary by
  the various branches of G.H.Q. of the state
  of the enemy's forces, our own numbers and
  <i>morale</i>, our possibilities of transport and
  supply.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

  <p>4. G.H.Q. had to arrange the supply, from
  Home and from its own workshops and
  local civilian workshops, of all the wonderful
  equipment of the forces, from a Tank
  and a 15-inch howitzer to a tin of dubbin;
  all the ammunition and all the food supplies
  to man and beast. There came to the ports
  of France every month for the B.E.F. about
  800,000 tons of stuff. The men to be fed
  totalled over 2,000,000 and the animals to
  be fed about 500,000. A month's supply
  of ammunition weighed about 260,000 tons.</p>

  <p>5. G.H.Q. managed a transport system which
  used constantly about half a million horses
  and mules and about 20,000 motor lorries,
  running over 9,000,000 motor miles per
  month; which carried on its light railways
  about 544,000 tons a month and ran every
  day 250 trains on broad gauge lines.</p>

  <p>6. G.H.Q. was constantly building new railways
  and new roads, and developing new
  harbour facilities. It ran big canal and
  sea services, forestry and agricultural
  services, repair shops, laundries, etc., on a
  gigantic scale.</p>

 <p> 7. G.H.Q managed the vast medical services
  for wounded and sick, the veterinary
  services, the laboratories for the defence of
  our men and animals against poison gas and
  for the gas counter-offensive. It was
  responsible for the organisation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
  Chaplains' services, for educational work
  and the amusement of the men.</p></blockquote>

<p>Such was the work of G.H.Q. It was carried
on under these varying conditions:</p>

  <blockquote><p>1. Maintaining a stabilised position. This
  was comparatively easy. Wastage of men,
  horses and material could be calculated
  with some certainty and replaced by a
  routine process.</p>

  <p>2. Preparing for a big attack. This made the
  greatest strain on Transport and Supply,
  and the necessary conditions of secrecy
  added complications and difficulties. In
  preparing an offensive the Traffic more
  than doubled per Division. The necessary
  making of new railways and new roads and
  the accumulation of defence material to
  fortify a new line were responsible for most
  of this. But the accumulation of a big
  head of ammunition was also a factor. On
  a quiet sector two Divisions could get along
  with about three trains daily. For the
  purposes of a big attack ten Divisions
  might be concentrated on that sector and
  those ten Divisions in the preparatory stage
  of the attack would need about 33 supply
  trains a day, and during the offensive about
  27 trains a day. Put the problem into
  terms of civil railway administration.
  Tell the manager of the London to Brighton
  line that next week he must carry 15 times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
  the normal traffic for a number of days and
  that it is extremely important that people
  observing his termini and his lines should
  not notice anything unusual.</p>

  <p>3. Resisting a big attack. The most difficult
  element of this was its unexpectedness.
  The total provision needed for it was less
  than for an offensive. The amount of
  supplies necessary to go up by train per
  Division from Base would be 25 per cent.
  less than in the case of the preparation of
  a big attack. We always carried a good
  reserve stock of ammunition, food, and
  engineering stores close behind the line, and
  a further reserve of ammunition already
  loaded on trains at appropriate railway
  centres. In case of emergency, ammunition
  could start moving up in just the time
  necessary to hitch a locomotive on to a
  standing train. Experience of the German
  offensive in 1918 showed that we carried
  near the front line too great reserves, and
  we lost a good deal of food, stores and
  ammunition in consequence. That big
  attack indeed disclosed several chinks in
  our armour. It showed that in some cases
  during Trench War units had allowed
  themselves to become immobile. (To give
  one example, many Casualty Clearing
  Stations had burdened themselves with
  surgical stores and equipment which should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
  be reserved for stationary hospitals. Thus
  burdened, they were tempted to evacuate
  too soon). There were weaknesses, too, in
  Ammunition Columns, and the railway
  system was not nearly elastic enough.
  But we pulled through, largely because the
  British officer and soldier has always a bit
  in reserve and never thinks so quickly or
  acts so bravely as when in a tight corner.</p>

  <p>4. Carrying on a general offensive. This was
  the supreme test of the British Staff from
  August, 1918, to November, 1918. It
  called for an effort that put in the category
  of easy things all that had gone before.
  The effort was gloriously successful. The
  British Army succeeded where the German
  Army in 1914, under far more favourable
  circumstances, had failed.</p></blockquote>

<p>I have given only the most important of the
functions of G.H.Q. and a very inadequate idea
of the conditions under which it had to carry on
its tasks, yet for all this there were only 300
officers at Montreuil and 240 officers at the
outlying directorates.</p>

<p>It did not leave much chance for idleness!
At G.H.Q., in my time, in my branch, no officer
who wished to stay was later than 9 a.m. at his
desk; most of the eager men were at work before
then. We left at 10.30 p.m. if possible, more
often later. On Saturday and Sunday exactly
the same hours were kept. "An hour for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
exercise" in the afternoon was supposed to be
reserved, in addition to meal-hours; but it was
not by any means always possible. During the
worst of the German offensive in the spring of
1918 Staff officers toiled from 8.30 a.m. to
midnight, with half-hour intervals for meals.
I have seen a Staff officer faint at table from
sheer pressure of work, and dozens of men, come
fresh from regimental work, wilt away under
the fierce pressure of work at G.H.Q.</p>

<p>The extreme character of the strain at
G.H.Q. used to be recognised by a special
allowance of leave. A short leave every three
months was, for a long time, the rule. With
pressure of work, that rule fell in abeyance,
and a G.H.Q. Staff Officer was lucky to get a
leave within six months. In the case of the
big men at the head of the departments leave
was something to be talked of, dreamt of, but
never realised. Compared with conditions at
G.H.Q. regimental work was care-free and
pleasant.</p>

<p>G.H.Q. was organised in this fashion. At
the head was the Commander-in-Chief and his
personal staff consisting of an Assistant
Military Secretary, a Private Secretary, a
Medical Officer, an Officer in charge of escorts
and five A.D.C.s. Attached to this personal
staff were an American and a French Staff
Officer. There was one officer of the Dominions
on the Chief's personal staff, Captain Botha, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
son of the late General Botha, Prime Minister
of South Africa. With his personal staff
the Commander-in-Chief was quartered at a
château near Montreuil.</p>

<p>One rarely saw "the Chief." He seldom
had occasion to come to the offices in the Ecole
Militaire, and it was only the highest officers
who had to go to confer with him. But his
presence was always felt. There was no more
loyal band of brothers than the Grand Staff of
the British Army in 1918, and the humblest
member at G.H.Q. expressed the spirit of the
Commander-in-Chief, and, within his sphere,
was trying to do exactly as the Commander-in-Chief
would do. When "the Chief" did
appear at Montreuil all felt they had the
right to desert work for five minutes to go to a
window to catch a glimpse of him as he passed
from one side of the Ecole Militaire to the
other, or stopped in the great courtyard to chat
for a moment with one of his officers.</p>

<p>Under the Chief the staff was divided into
branches. There was the "Military Secretary's
Branch," a small branch under Major-General
H. G. Ruggles-Brise, whose duties were to look
after honours, promotions, etc. There was the
General Staff Branch, under Lieut.-General the
Hon. Sir H. A. Lawrence, divided into the
Operations Section, under Major-General J. H.
Davidson (having charge of the actual strategy
and tactics in the campaign); the Staff Duties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Section, under Major-General G. P. Dawnay;
and the Intelligence Section, under Brigadier-General
G. S. Clive (having charge of the
collection of information as to the enemy's
movements, dispositions, intentions, etc.). There
was the Adjutant-General's Branch, under
Lieutenant-General Sir G. H. Fowke (having
charge of discipline). There was the Quartermaster-General's
Branch, under Lieutenant-General
Sir Travers Clarke (having charge of
supply and transport). Finally there were
certain officers with special duties attached to
G.H.Q. but not directly under any of these
branches, such as the Officer Commanding Royal
Artillery, the Inspector of Machine Gun Units,
the Engineer-in-Chief, the officers in charge of
Mines and Searchlights, the Inspector of
Training, the Chief Chaplains, the Provost
Marshal, and the Deputy Judge Advocate-General.</p>

<p>Of the branches of the Staff, the Quartermaster-General's
was far the greatest, for under
it came all the transport and supply services.
This was the formidable list:</p>

  (Brig.-Gen. the Earl of Radnor).</p>

  <p>Director of Army Postal Services (Brig.-Gen.

  <p>Vice-Chairman Imperial War Graves Commission
  (Major-Gen. Ware).</p>

  <p>Director of Works (Major-Gen. Sir A. M.
  Stuart).</p></blockquote>

<p>Nor does that finish the list, for subsidiary
directorates under the Director-General of
Transportation were:</p>

  <blockquote><p>Director of Construction (Brig.-Gen.
  Stewart).</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

  <p>Director of Docks (Brig.-Gen. Wedgewood).</p>

  <p>Director of Inland Water Transport (Brig.-Gen.
  Luck).</p>

  <p>Director of Light Railways (Brig.-Gen.
  Harrison).</p>

  <p>Director of Railway Traffic (Brig.-Gen.
  Murray).</p>

  <p>Director of Roads (Brig.-Gen. Maybury).</p></blockquote>

<p>The Transportation Directorate was, so to
speak, a sub-branch of the Staff. It had a
great standard-gauge railway system which
kept 900 locomotives running, which in one day
could send 196 trains from the Bases to railheads
(this irrespective of trains on lateral
lines) and in one week once moved 439,801
troops and in one month 1,539,410 troops. Its
railway system was constantly being pushed
forward, being duplicated, and being furnished
with "avoiding lines." Further, Transportation
had a light railway system which carried
174,923 tons a week. Those were only two of
its activities. On inland waterways, Transportation
carried 293,593 tons a month, and it
worked, in addition, a coastal barge traffic, a
cross-Channel barge service, and a cross-Channel
Ferry. Of roads, it maintained about
4,106 miles and was always making new ones;
and it took 4,400 tons of material&mdash;much of it
imported by sea&mdash;to make a mile of new road.</p>

<p>These figures are impressive enough in
themselves and yet give little real sense of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
full task of the Transportation Services. That
can only be realised when it is kept in mind that
practically all the work had to be carried out
under conditions of shock and violent movement.
It was not a matter of peacefully carrying on a
routine business. At every point there was a
constant liability to interruption and destruction
by enemy action. At every hour there was
some new development requiring some change
of method, of destination. The vast machine
had to be as elastic as it was powerful.</p>

<p>Yet that was only one sub-branch of the Staff.</p>

<p>It will be of interest to note how all the
directorates of the Q Branch of the Staff were
co-ordinated so that the man at the top could
keep control and yet not be smothered under a
mass of detail. Under the head (Lieutenant-General
Sir Travers Clarke) of this Branch of
the Staff were two deputies (Major-General
Ford and Major-General May). Under these
deputies were five Brigadier-Generals, and
under them nine Lieutenant-Colonels, and these
Lieutenant-Colonels divided between them 82
subjects. A table showing the distribution of
these subjects was circulated throughout the
Staff, and most matters got to the right officer
from the beginning, and if they were of a
routine nature were dealt with at once without
further reference. Very important matters, or
new questions arising, went up to one of the
Deputies and were referred, or not, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Q.M.G. as the circumstances dictated.
Attached to the Branch and directly under its
head was an officer who had charge of all orders
and all publications. Nothing could be sent
out as an order from the Q.M.G. Branch, or
nothing printed as an instruction from the
Branch, until it had gone through his hands;
and it was his duty to see that one section of
the Branch did not tread on the toes of another,
that orders and publications did not overlap,
and that an order in which several directorates
were interested was drafted in accordance with
the views of all of them.</p>

<p>Other Branches of the Staff did not call for
such elaborate organisation, for their duties
were not so various. But all worked on very
much the same plan&mdash;of delegating authority so
that once a line of action on any particular
point was decided upon, a comparatively junior
staff officer could "carry on" without worrying
his superiors by frequent references.</p>

<p>A G.H.Q. officer was distinguished not only
by his red staff badges but by a red and blue
arm-band. An "attached officer," <i>i.e.</i>, an
officer who was working with the staff as a
learner or a helper and was perhaps graded
for pay, etc., as a staff officer, did not wear these
distinctions until he was actually appointed to
the Staff.</p>

<p>The red and blue arm-band was a chromatic
outrage&mdash;its glaring colours of course had a
purpose&mdash;and quite spoiled the appearance of
a tunic. But it was dearly prized and as a rule.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
was worn on leave, though it had then no usefulness.
In the field the distinguishing arm-band
was of great use, to indicate to officers and men
the officials to whom they could appeal in case
of need. There were all sorts of arm-bands
with various colour symbols and initials in
addition to the G.H.Q. one. A list of them
will indicate the complexity of the task of a
modern army in the field. Special arm-bands
of different designs were authorised to distinguish:</p>

<p>The Military Police were supposed to be able
to keep all these in memory and an officer in
the field had to know the chief ones; and he took
care to know at least that for G.H.Q., for it
represented the ultimate source of honour and
blame. Nothing important could happen to
him except through G.H.Q., and that ugly red
and blue arm-band always demanded attention,
sometimes, no doubt, mixed with a little
resentment, because of the idea that G.H.Q.
had nothing much to do except to bother the
unhappy regimental officer.</p>

<p>We all tried to "live up to" our arm-bands
in the crude stained-glass-window colours.
The Commander-in-Chief set a high example
by choosing his men carefully, giving them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
their particular jobs and trusting them. He
was not one of those fussy souls who want to
oversee every detail. The men who worked
under him knew that whilst they did their work
conscientiously and carefully he would back
them against any niggling criticism and against
any back-biting. It was a good policy judged
by its results. G.H.Q., B.E.F., France, in
the summer of 1918 had probably reached as
high a summit of soldierly scientific skill as the
grand Staff of any Army in the world. The
business of improvisation which had been begun
in 1914 was finished, actually finished. From
G.H.Q. was directed day by day a fighting force
which met the chief brunt of the last German
attack, held it; then, while it absorbed a great
flood of recruits and helped to equip and train
the American Army, prepared to take the chief
part in the final victorious offensive.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h4>G.H.Q. AT PLAY.</h4>

<h4>The walks on the Ramparts&mdash;The "Monks" of
Montreuil had little time for sport&mdash;Precautions
against "joy-riding"&mdash;The jolly Officers' Club&mdash;Watching
the Map&mdash;Ladies at G.H.Q.?</h4>


<p>There was precious little play-time at
G.H.Q. But there was some. It was spent
very innocently; not to say stodgily. A walk
on the Ramparts was the chief recreation of the
great majority of the officers.</p>

<p>What a boon those Ramparts were! Within
a minute from the Ecole Militaire one could get
on the broad walk which crowned the old walls
and could follow it round the whole circuit of
the town for a mile or more. From every point
there was a rich and ample prospect; southward
over the swelling downs and little copses
towards the forest of Crécy; westward over a
richer and more luxuriant plain towards the
sea; northward across the woods and marshes
of the Canche; eastward along the valley of the
river and its bordering hills. On a fine day at
the coming up and the going down of the sun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and every hour between, there was a constant
festival of light and colour. Stormy and rainy
skies gave another beauty to the wide prospect.
To see a storm march up in grand procession
and pass with its sombre pomp was a fearful
joy; and there was a wild beauty, too, in looking
out from the walls on the beating of the
obstinate rains against hill and plain. Painters
from all over the world used to come to
Montreuil to attempt to put on canvas the glow
of its summer scenes, the wild grandeur of its
winters. No day was without its special
beauty, and the beauty was ever renewed afresh.</p>

<p>In the early spring the chinks and crannies
of the old walls burst into bloom of gillyflowers
which hung them with tapestries of gold
and red and brown, contrasting gaily with the
bright green foliage of the trees growing at the
base of the Ramparts and throwing their
branches up to their very top. As the season
advanced the birds came to build in the trees,
and you might peep down into their nests and
hear their indignant chirrups at being so closely
overlooked. With summer and autumn came
new colours, but always splendour and glow and
movement. The country around carried that
wide variety of crops in which the French
peasant's thrifty and careful culture delights.
There were beans and oats and wheat and corn
and flax and mustard and bits of pasturage, and
of fodder crops, weaving their many colours
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>into a delightful carpet pattern which changed
with every day of the year and almost with
every hour of the day.</p>

<p><a name="i_0079"></a></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/page_0079.jpg" width="600" height="392" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">THE RAMPARTS</span>
</div>

<p>Had it not been for those Rampart walks the
toilsome life of G.H.Q. at Montreuil would
have been hardly possible. The road from
anywhere to anywhere, if time allowed, was by
the Ramparts. Going from the Ecole Militaire
to the Officers' Club was three minutes by the
street, seven minutes by the Ramparts, and most
went by the Ramparts unless work was
hideously pressing. For those with a little
more time to spare there were enchanting
rambles around the base of the Ramparts along
the Canche valley or in the old fosses of the
fortifications.</p>

<p>Riding was not a common exercise. Horses
were scarce. Very few officers had their own
chargers; and those who had could not find
time to exercise them properly. So most of
the horses at G.H.Q. were pooled, and an
officer having time and inclination took what
horse was available. There were many
pleasant rides, the favourite one being a shady
stretch along the bank of the river.</p>

<p>At one point of the fortifications an old fosse
had been converted into hard tennis courts, and
these were used a little, but not much. It seems
tiresome to be always repeating the same fact
but really there was not time to follow tennis
or any other sport. At the Officers' Club there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
was not such a thing as a billiard table; and I
never saw a game of cards played there. In
some of the private messes there was a feeble
attempt to keep up a Bridge or a Poker circle.
But to begin to play at cards at 11 p.m. with
the knowledge that the office is calling for a
clear rested brain by nine the next morning,
needs far more than ordinary enthusiasm. I
can remember playing cards only three nights
during all my time at Montreuil.</p>

<p>There was a theatre at Montreuil, usually
given up to cinema shows but occasionally
visited by the variety companies which were
organised for the amusement of the troops and
occasionally also converted into a lecture hall.
It was well patronised on special occasions, but
in the course of a year made little total demand
on officers' time. When, as was usually the
case, the theatre was given up to "the
pictures" it was filled by "other ranks."
The non-commissioned officers and privates who
were clerks in the various departments had
generally just as little leisure as their officers,
but some of the military population had more
time to spare; what section I do not know, for
even the grooms and the batmen had not
easy places. Officers junior to the rank of
lieutenant-colonel were not allowed a batman to
themselves, but one soldier acted for two or
three officers and had various fatigue duties in
addition.</p>

<p><a name="i_0083"></a></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/page_0083.jpg" width="600" height="378" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">THE THEATRE</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>
<p>Just outside the town, G.H.Q. Recreation
Ground provided a lumpy football ground and
a still more lumpy cricket ground. Both our
national games languished, however, for the
stock reason&mdash;want of time. There were teams,
and occasional matches, and sometimes an
enthusiastic sportsman would send an urgent
whip round to call attention to our deplorable
neglect of the games that made England great.
He would get a few half-hearted promises of
reform, but there was no hope in fighting
against the great obstacle. It was like a college
in which every one was a "swotter."</p>

<p>So the 300 or so Monks of Montreuil lived
their laborious lives. The balance of G.H.Q.
staff, some 250, scattered about the environs of
Montreuil with their offices at Paris Plage or
Le Touquet or the Forest of Crécy, could
follow a somewhat milder discipline. They
were "Second Echelon" mostly. Current
operations had not much concern for them and
it was possible to take horse-back exercise, to
keep up football and cricket and even tennis and
golf. At Le Touquet, which was a well-known
pleasure centre before the war, there were good
golf links and some excellent tennis courts. On
occasions the Commander-in-Chief decided to
think out his problems over a round of golf, and
a little bungalow was maintained at Le Touquet
for his convenience.</p>

<p>Paris Plage was a splendid beach, but so far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
as G.H.Q. officers were concerned its attractions
were wasted. Occasionally an officer having
business at one of the Directorates near by
would spare an hour for a swim, but it was not
possible on a hot Saturday or Sunday to suspend
the battle, or the preparation for the battle, in
progress and adjourn as a body to the seaside.
Not only time but transport was lacking. The
only means of getting down to the beach&mdash;a
distance of about twelve miles&mdash;was by motor-car,
and regulations against "joy-riding"
were strict. Not only were there regulations;
there were also precautions to see that the
regulations were kept. A car could go out from
G.H.Q. garage only on an order from the officer
in charge of cars, and it was his business to get
a chit as to what was the reason for the journey.
Occasionally police patrols would be stationed
on the roads with instructions to stop every car
and examine its papers. This was excused as
a precaution against espionage. It was
designed more to be a precaution against waste
of petrol or "joy-riding," as a few officers
found to their cost.</p>

<p>So the life of the Montreuil officer resolved
itself ordinarily into this simple routine: he
worked and he walked on the Ramparts. But
there was one fine relief to tedium for the
majority&mdash;a dinner-party every night. The
big generals, because they had to, and a few
unwise souls, because they chose to, favoured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
private messes and confronted at dinner at
night the same men as they met in the office all
day; and, without a doubt, found it rather
monotonous. The majority of the officers
messed at the Officers' Club, which had a couple
of hundred members and could rival the old
reputation of the House of Commons as "the
finest Club in Europe."</p>

<p>The qualification for joining the Officers'
Club was to be an officer of the British Army or
of an Allied Army stationed at Montreuil. The
subscription was five francs per month, and for
that and a ridiculously small sum per day the
Club gave members three square meals a day
and afternoon tea. The Club kept up a good
cellar, and to the very last, when good wine was
almost unprocurable in London or Paris except
at exorbitant prices, the Officers' Club,
Montreuil, could sell a vintage claret or
burgundy at nine francs a bottle, a decent wine
at five francs a bottle, and champagne at
fifteen francs a bottle. The Expeditionary
Force Canteens were the caterers, and aimed at
only a nominal profit. Once a week there was
a fixed guest night and a band, but members
could bring guests at any time. Waiting was
done by Q.M.A.A.C.s, neat deft little ladies
who brought a hint of home to the exiles.</p>

<p>Custom was against forming coteries. So
there were constantly differing dinner-parties,
and the conversation was rich in variety and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
interest. The backbone of the Mess were the
Regular Army officers, the majority of them
colonels, with a sprinkling of brigadiers, a few
majors and a few captains. The majority in
the Mess, however, were temporary officers, a
few of senior rank, mostly staff captains or
attached officers. There were always some
visitors, a politician or some other personage
from home, staff officers from the War Office or
from the various Armies, regimental officers
having business at G.H.Q., guests from the
various private messes at Montreuil.</p>

<p>Talk ranged from the most serious shop to
the most airy nothings. There were experts
there in almost every department of human
knowledge, men who had seen many cities
and known the minds of many men. The
representatives of the Allied nations gave an
extra note of variety. You might sit at the
same table with an American one night, an
Italian another, or a Frenchman or Belgian or
Portuguese. The majority of men present were
distinguished men either in the Service or in
some civil profession or business. Travel,
science, art and literature, were all well
represented.</p>

<span class="caption">IN THE OFFICERS' CLUB</span>
</div>

<p>Smoking was prohibited in the Officers' Club
until a certain hour, and the Q.M.A.A.C.
waitresses had no difficulty in seeing that the
rule was kept by all ranks. At an earlier date,
when a sergeant-major with men orderlies had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
charge of the waiting, discipline on this point
was not so easily maintained. Any junior
officer lighting up before the hour was promptly
checked. But a sergeant-major found it
difficult to take "disciplinary action" against
an officer of General rank. One evening a very
lofty general indeed, a visitor to the Mess,
started a huge cigar at 8 o'clock. Smoking was
not allowed until 8.20. The sergeant-major
was a man of resource. Bringing in a ladder,
he mounted to the Mess clock and solemnly set
it on to 8.20. A General was smoking, therefore
it must be 8.20.</p>

<p>As I have said, they fed us very well at the
Mess. But of course we grumbled at the food
and found one point of criticism in the fish.
Montreuil being practically a seaside town, the
fish was naturally not good, authority having
transferred to this English colony in France the
invariable tradition of British seaside resorts
to send all the fresh fish away and consume the
refuse. Our fish was always plaice, and it was
often plaice that had known better days. One
wag spoke of it as the "vintage plaice,"
professed to know that it had been "laid
down" the year the war started, and that the
"bins" would not be exhausted until the war
ended.</p>

<p>But the plaice was never a really serious
grievance. It gave opportunity, but not valid
cause, to grumble, and discussion of it died<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
away after an officer one night quoted mock
heroically:</p>

<div class="poem">
Ah, friend&mdash;had this indubitable fact<br />
Haply occurred to poor Leonidas<br />
How had he turned tail on Thermopulai!<br />
It cannot be that even his few wits<br />
Were addled to the point that, so advised,<br />
Preposterous he had answered&mdash;"Cakes are prime,<br />
Hearth-sides are snug, sleek dancing-girls have worth,<br />
And yet for country's sake, to save our gods<br />
Their temples, save our ancestors their tombs,<br />
Save wife and child and home and liberty,&mdash;I<br />
would chew sliced-salt-fish, bear snow&mdash;nay, starve<br />
If need were&mdash;and by much prefer the choice!"
</div>

<p>After dinner the routine was to go and look
at the map before settling down again to work.
Military Intelligence, in one of its rooms, kept
up-to-date hour-by-hour a map of the fighting
front, and after dinner we would crowd to this
room to see the latest official news put up on the
map and to hear the latest unofficial stories
which embroidered the news. One evening,
as a great advance on our part was marked up
on the map, the clerk, moving the flag-pins,
announced:</p>

<p>"They say the enemy cleared out so quickly
that they left the hospitals behind, and the
Australian corps has captured 50 German
nurses. They report that they are looking well
after them."</p>

<p>A titter went round the group of officers. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
happened to be the night after the story had
circulated&mdash;a story which President Wilson
has since adopted among his family of
anecdotes&mdash;that the Australians, having the
Americans to co-operate with, had had to
remonstrate with them for their undue rudeness
to the Germans. The Australians had a
reputation for being quite direct enough in
their method of teaching the Boche not to be a
Boche.</p>

<p>The titter, perhaps, had an injurious
inference to some ears, for a General officer
remarked, a little sternly:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, the Australians are a gallant
race. The German&mdash;er&mdash;ladies will be quite
safe with them."</p>

<p>So, of course, it proved. It was fiction that
any Colonial troops showed an undue sternness
to prisoners. The average German knew that
he was quite safe in the hands of any British
unit&mdash;whether it was from Australia, Canada,
or the Motherland.</p>

<p>The after-dinner peep at the map was a great
finish to dinner. When the Armistice was
signed officers were disconsolate for the loss of
their ten minutes in the M.I. room. "I miss,"
said one, "our pleasant daily habit of
advancing ten kilomètres on a front of fifty
kilomètres."</p>

<p>No, life at G.H.Q. was sober and strenuous,
but it was not dull or tedious. If a man has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
good work to do, lovely aspects of Nature to look
upon, interesting company at his meals, he has
all the real essentials of contentment; well,
most of them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ladies at G.H.Q.? An almost accurate
chapter might be written on this point on
the lines adopted in that exhaustive and
conscientious book on Iceland, which had a
brief chapter:</p>

<div class="center"><p><i>The Snakes of Iceland.</i></p>

<p>There are no snakes in Iceland.</p></div>

<p>There were no ladies at G.H.Q., not at any
rate in the sense that would be in the mind of
the average inquirer. On the too rare occasions
when I was able to get a leave from G.H.Q., or
was sent over to London on a task, the civilians I
encountered in London exhibited a considerable
interest in the ladies that were thought to
haunt G.H.Q.</p>

<p>This was by no manner of means an entirely
or indeed a mainly feminine curiosity. Many
people have an ineradicable idea that an Army
on a campaign ravages the hearts of all the
female population of the occupied territory, as
well as drawing on the beauty of its own land
to recruit charming camp followers. I can
recall, on returning from a small war some time
before 1914, attending a dinner-party in
London and being tremendously flattered at the
fact that as soon as the ladies went upstairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
all the men (some of them very distinguished
men) crowded round me in a spirit of inquiry.
With all the resources at my disposal I framed
in my mind a brief and vivid appreciation of the
campaign. But&mdash;they did not want to know
why the Turkish Army failed or the Serbian
Army succeeded. Someone rather well known
in London had got into a scrape in the course
of the campaign, and there were some very
scandalous details alleged. My eager inquirers
wanted to know all those scandalous details,
and were obviously disappointed to learn that
there was no reasonable foundation for them,
and at once lost all interest in the campaign.
My "appreciation" had not the chance to be
uttered.</p>

<p>Probably they concluded I was rather an
unintelligent person not to have discovered all
the horrid details. Certainly those to whom I
told the truth about the ladies and G.H.Q.
thought I was either very sly or very
unobservant. Indeed one very hearty old
gentleman, with a great passion for horrid
details, patted me on the back publicly.</p>

<p>"That's right, that's right. I admire you
for sticking to your friends. But of course we
do not believe you."</p>

<p>Categorically, it is <i>not</i> a fact that "beautiful
leaders of British society" constantly graced
G.H.Q. with their presence. In the very early
stages of the war some of the "Smart Set"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
considered it rather the thing to get over to the
battlefields and make a week-end sensation of a
glimpse at the Calvary of Civilisation. They
usually got over through the influence of
political friends, and most often by way of the
Belgian section of the Front, which was not so
sternly guarded as the British or French
sections. Military authority discountenanced
these visits&mdash;however "fashionable" and
beautiful the visitors&mdash;and soon put a stop
to them. After 1914, except nurses and
Q.M.A.A.C.s it was very rare for a woman to
enter British Army areas. Those few who did
come had very definite business and were
expected to attend very strictly to that business
and then to move off.</p>

<p>There was a suspicion that some few, a very
few, "workers" were in France not so much
for work as because they found it amusing.
These got no further than the Base ports as a
rule, and were not officially encouraged. The
vast majority of the women workers in France
were there for patriotism's sake, attended
strictly to their business, and had no time (or
inclination, presumably) for frivolity.</p>

<p>All this is very disappointing, I am aware.
But it is true. The life we lived at G.H.Q.
was truly monastic. We never saw an English
woman unless she were a nurse or Q.M.A.A.C.
or some other uniformed fellow-officer or fellow-soldier.</p>

<span class="caption">THE PLACE GAMBETTA</span>
</div>

<p>Nor was there any idle local feminine society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
to take the thoughts of officers from the stern
tasks of war. Montreuil was very, very prim
and dull even for a small French provincial
town. There may still be some people whose
ideas of French social life are based on those
quarters of Paris whose theatres, books, newspapers,
restaurants, manners are shaped by the
wishes (or fancied wishes) of the floating
population of visitors and of a small section of
idle and worthless French. But I fancy that in
these days such people are few; and most people
know that the average of French life is not at
all like Montmartre or the Latin Quarter,
which are less typical of France than, say,
Piccadilly Circus is of England. For thorough
straight-laced respectability there is nothing to
beat a small French provincial town.</p>

<p>Montreuil was the most respectable place one
could imagine before the war. It sheltered a
small colony of artists in the summer, attracted
by the wonderful panoramas from the ramparts;
but they came to work, and did not bring with
them what is supposed to be the atmosphere of
the Latin Quarter. The local population was
exceedingly decorous and rather inclined to be
clerical in sympathy, for Montreuil was a great
centre for schools.</p>

<p>During our occupation of the town as the
home of G.H.Q. there might be noted
occasionally the arrival from Paris, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
elsewhere, of some gay young lady or couple of
ladies who, having heard that the British Army
had its headquarters there, had decided, from
motives of patriotism, of <i>camaraderie</i>, or from
less admirable motives, to come and enliven the
dullness of the place. Departure would follow
with ungallant promptitude. The same day,
or the next, the lady would move away, with a
gendarme to see that she did not miss her train.</p>

<p>The monastic severity of life at G.H.Q.
relaxed a little, I think, when the immediate
environs of Montreuil were passed. Then you
had got out of the area of First Echelon G.H.Q.
and were in that of the Second Echelon, which
was largely made of subsidiary services not so
directly concerned with the administration of
the fighting Army. Life was a little less
strenuous, and perhaps Aphrodite was not
altogether neglected for Ares. Here conditions
reflected the average attitude of the British
Army administration in the matter of morals,
which was practically that of British civilian
life, with somewhat more precaution and
guardianship but no grandmotherly supervision.
The female personnel of the Army was
very carefully safeguarded. The male
personnel, if it were absolutely bent on it, could
find opportunities for mischief in some of the
Base towns. G.H.Q. itself&mdash;partly perhaps
because of the necessity of extreme safeguards
against espionage&mdash;was expected to lead a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
strictly single life; to conform to the perfect
standard that was supposed to rule in the
Provost Marshal's branch. That rigour, of
course, was dictated not by an exceptional
prudery in the P.M. authorities but by military
convenience. Ordinarily, outside of G.H.Q.
and the Provost Marshal's branch, there was
a margin allowed for human error.</p>

<p>Paris Plage, the jolly beach at the mouth of
the Canche near Montreuil, was for a long time
"out-of-bounds" to all British troops. Paris
Plage had, in pre-war days, rather a "Montmartre"
reputation in Paris. It was the beach
for the cheap tripper. It was the beach to
which the hardworking <i>bourgeois</i> of the city
who had to stick to his bureau during the
summer sent his wife, and came down to see her
on Sundays. It was also the beach for the Don
Juan of modest means to visit with his
temporary Juanita. Not this Paris reputation
reacting on the traditional British hypocrisy
caused the long-standing ban on Paris Plage,
but practical sanitary reasons. It had not then
a good reputation from the point of view of
health. But as the size and the activities of
G.H.Q. increased and it was necessary to find
places for new departments near Montreuil,
Paris Plage had to be utilised. After being
subjected to a drastic sanitary inquisition it
was thrown open to the troops and became the
headquarters of several minor departments.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>But of course the old gay life did not return.
It was no longer a suburb of Montmartre. Still
it preserved a certain air of rakishness. Going
through there in a car one day with another
staff officer we noticed a little shop in the
windows of which were displayed very
coquettishly two or three filmy articles of
feminine <i>dessous</i>. A lightning glance through
the door showed that there was quite a bevy of
fair shop assistants&mdash;about three assistants to
each item of merchandise. In the window
there was this simple device, in English:</p>

<p>CHEQUES CASHED.</p>

<p>We dared not investigate further. A
G.H.Q. car is so clearly recognisable as such
that it could not stop outside, and the subterfuge
of drawing up at the Directorate of
Inkstands and making a reconnaissance on foot
we felt to be <i>infra dig</i>. It was only possible to
pass the shop slowly on the return journey, and
to look out for it the next month when going
that way again. It was still open, still bore
its artless device. It was a little bit of the
old life of Paris Plage that had escaped the
shocks of war.</p>

<p>In very truth we were a dull lot from one
point of view. Even the conversation at meals
was ordinarily wanting in that type of anecdote
which&mdash;as Walpole said when he was asked why
it was rife at his table, where sat the greatest
men of Europe, who should have had something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
better to talk about&mdash;is popular "because every
man understands it." Perhaps the propriety
of our conversation was partly due to the fact
that there was nearly always a padre within
earshot. Perhaps I may dare the explanation
of the general absence of "sex interest" in
our lives, that here were gathered together a
band of men with very exacting and very
important work to do, and that they simply had
not time nor inclination to bother about what is
usually an amusement of idle lives.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h4>THE MUNITIONS OF THE WAR.</h4>

<h4>The Shell shortage&mdash;When relief came&mdash;The
dramatic Tanks&mdash;Bombs&mdash;Some ammunition
figures&mdash;The ingenious inventor.</h4>


<p>As soon as any subject is involved in political
discussion the facts about it are apt to be
distorted in the interests of some particular
view. The "Shell shortage" in the early
stages of the war has become in a sense a
political issue; and that I do not intend to
discuss. But some facts about munitions
supply must be given&mdash;for that was the very
pivot of the war&mdash;irrespective of what political
case they help or harm.</p>

<p>The British Force at the outset of the war
suffered from a shell and gun shortage as
compared with its enemy, because it had been
trained and equipped for a different type of
warfare from that which actually came. It had
very little high explosive shell, and what it had
was rarely "high explosive" in the real sense
of the term. The patient search for a foolproof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
fuse had been so successful that our H.E.
shell was comparatively inoffensive when it
reached the enemy's lines. It spluttered off
rather than shattered off. All this was put
right in time. But the difficulties which the
Munitions Supply Department had to face
at the outset were enormous. There were,
considered in the lights of the needs of this
war, practically no shells, no guns, and no
machinery for making them. Essential material
was lacking in many cases, and the only source
of quick supply was Germany, which alone in
the world had organised for war.</p>

<p>But all difficulties were overcome. How
great the growth some comparative figures will
show. The production of high explosive in
1914 was almost negligible. The year's supply
would not keep the guns of 1918 going for a
day. In 1915 we began to produce high
explosive on a large scale, and in amounts which
made the 1914 output seem contemptible, but
still in quite inadequate quantities. In 1916
we had increased the 1915 amount sevenfold.
In 1917 we had increased that 1916 amount
fourfold. From March, 1915, to March, 1917,
the increase was twenty-eight fold. Of
machine-guns we made samples in 1914 and we
began to manufacture quantities in 1915. In
1917 we made twenty times as many as in 1915.
Of aeroplanes the figures mounted in steep
flights. In 1916 we seemed to be producing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
vastly. In 1917 the rate of production for the
first six months had increased fourfold as
compared with the previous year, and another
great acceleration was in progress.</p>

<p>In the end we were enormously superior to
any other Army in the field in the matter of
munitions. To the very day of the Armistice
improvements in the quality and rate of
productions were still going on in preparation
for the Spring, 1919, campaign, which it was
anticipated would end the war. The German
threw up the sponge before then. If he had
waited he would have been literally blown out
of his trenches and his chief cities.</p>

<p>In one sense, of course, we never had enough,
but if I were asked to name a date on which
a serious shortage of munitions ceased I should
say September 19th, 1915, on the eve of the
battle of Loos. On that date, a year after
Trench War began, word was passed around
to the batteries of the British line in a phrase
copied from the provision shops of London:
"Ammunition is cheap to-day." Every gun-pit
stocked up with shell. The gates of the
dumps were opened and shell fairly poured out.
Battery Commanders, who knew the days when
one shell per gun per day was the limit allowed,
saw with joy thousands of shells, and, as they
began eagerly to fire them off, thousands more
coming.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of September a regular bombardment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of the whole German line facing the
British line began. The artillery was undertaking
the preliminary work of wire-cutting
and parapet pounding. The 18-pounders with
shrapnel, the howitzers with high explosive,
started at dawn, and all through the day
systematically smashed away at the German's
defences. That went on for two more days.
The fourth day we intensified our shell-fire.
Along many sections of the Front the German
wire was down, and the parapet of the German
trench breached. The enemy increased his
artillery fire, too, attacking our trenches and
searching for our observing stations and
batteries, but on the whole getting the worst of
the artillery duel. On the morning of the 25th
the final artillery duel began. It was the
greatest artillery bombardment in history up
to that date, though afterwards so eclipsed by
the records of the Somme, the Ancre and of
Messines as to be remembered as a mere splutter.
But at the time it was vastly impressive.</p>

<p>The morning was dull but the flashes of guns
were so continuous as to give a light which was
almost unbroken. It flickered, but it never
failed. The earth itself quivered and shook
with the repeated shocks of the guns. The air
became a tattered hunted thing, torn wisps of
it blown hither and thither by the constant
explosions.</p>

<p>The Battle of Loos did not give us the break-through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
we expected, but, in so far as my
observation is worth anything, the reason was
not lack of munitions. Loos showed that the
task was a more complicated one than merely
smashing down the front line of enemy trenches.
"Trench War" was resumed, whilst the
British Army prepared for the next phase
opening in July, 1916, with the first Battle of the
Somme. By then munitions supply had grown
gigantically and in the mechanics of war we
were far ahead of the Germans. This was not
only in artillery but in infantry equipment and
in our unique weapon the "Tank," which was
the mechanical contrivance having the most
decisive results on the issue of the war. These
appeared in September, 1916, two years after
"Trench War" had begun, and were
ultimately destined to make that sort of war
impossible, a task which the German poison
gas had failed to accomplish.</p>

<p>As a race we are never consciously dramatic,
or I would have imagined on that September
1916 morning that the arrival of the Tanks on
the Somme front had been carefully timed and
stage-managed. The morning was dull and
misty. Over the seared and terrible land little
wisps of fog rose and fell. All likeness to our
gentle mother earth had been battered out of
the fields, which were rubbish-heaps of churned-up
débris of bodies, dust, weapons&mdash;hideously
pock-marked by the eruption of the shells.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Where had been villages were dirtier patches of
desolation. Where had been woods, groups of
splintered stumps. It was an abomination of
desolation, like as when the earth was first
formed out of the void. In the midst of this
desolation out of the mist came, crawling
uncouthly, the Tanks, like prehistoric saurians.</p>

<p>The German forces were obviously frightened
by the Tanks, which climbed over their trenches,
and impervious to rifle bullets, smashed up
machine-gun emplacements and redoubts. But
that Tank of 1916 was nothing like the
perfected machine of 1918. Its rear steering
wheel was a weak-spot liable to be shot away.
Its pace was too slow for it to keep up with
charging infantry. No real tactics had been
evolved for its use.</p>

<p>But, such as it was, that Tank at first brought
alarm to more than the enemy. In going to
and from the battle front it "got the wind up"
many a British dug-out. Here is an artillery
officer's yarn of the first "Tank night":</p>

<p>"Our 'Mess' was a roofed-over shell-hole a
mile or so in front of Martinpuich. The roof
would keep out shrapnel bits but was no use
against a direct hit from a shell. I was Orderly
Dog for the night and it was my business to take
action, when, outside, a strange spluttering,
growling, scratching, spitting sound broke into
the steady barking of the guns. It was like a
thousand cats, a hundred dogs, and a sea-sick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
elephant or two scrambling and squabbling
together in a dust-hole. I went to investigate.
A Tank wandering home was within ten yards
of our Mess, heading straight for it. With all
the <i>insouciance</i> I could command at such a
crisis I begged the Tank to stop; urged that our
roof was designed to keep out splinters only
and was neither shell-proof nor Tank-proof;
pointed out that if it persisted in its course
seven artillery officers, some of whom had wives
and children, and all of whom had mothers,
would be pulped. Then I became calmer and
told the Tank that there was some wine in
the Mess and even some whisky and soda, if
the Tank would now stop and have a drink.
Fortunately a Tank is a slow mover and my
cooler arguments had effect by the time it had
got within five yards of our roof-tree. Then
it backed water and we were safe. The Tank
is a noble animal, but it adds a little to the
anxieties of life underground."</p>

<span class="caption">THE FOSSE</span>
</div>

<p>"The Tank" was the great mechanical find
of the war, and it was an all-British find. High
authority had many fine name-proposals for the
useful monsters, but Tommy took the matter
into his own hands and coined the word
"Tank," and "Tank" it remained. Those
who are interested in matters of language may
note that the French do not use the word
"Tank" but describe a "Tank" as a
<i>char d'assaut</i>, which is accurate, but has a weak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
look. It is an illustration of their jealous and
admirable care of their language. They will
not allow foreign words to intrude if that can
be avoided. We, on the other hand, are quite
careless about our language. The orders of our
Army in France were bespattered with French
words and phrases for which there were quite
good English equivalents. (<i>Gare <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'regulatrice'">régulatrice</ins></i>
for "distributing station" is one of the many
scores of cases in point.) It is a pity that we
are so careless in regard to our mother tongue.
I made an effort once to persuade G.H.Q. that
British Army orders and instructions should be
put out in English without any foreign
admixture, but met with little sympathy. The
intrusion of French words was not so bad, but
German words had an almost equal degree of

<p>But to return to our munitions. The hand
bomb was a weapon which by 1914 we had
allowed to fall out of use. The British
Grenadiers no longer threw grenades. But
Trench War brought back the bomb as a
weapon, and our bomb was soon better than the
German bomb. At the first Somme battle
(1916) we showed a definite superiority in bomb
supply and bomb use. This development was
altogether in our favour. The bomb&mdash;beastly
weapon as it is, and beastly as are the wounds
it inflicts&mdash;lends its favour to the quicker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
brain, the prompter courage, the keener leadership.
The football field and the cricket green
both give a good foundation for the murderous
art of bombing. As soon as we had the bombs
our bombing superiority grew with every day.</p>

<p>An instance to illustrate bombing: For the
taking of the village of Contalmaison (1916) a
preliminary task was the capture of Horse Shoe
trench. The attack on this was prospering
when it was held up at a critical point by the
unmasking of a German machine gun on our
right flank. To the fire of this gun we were
fully exposed, and its effect was murderous. A
young cricketer rose to the occasion. Single-handed
he rushed the gun with a bag of bombs,
got to his distance and destroyed it with a
couple of "hot returns from the outfield."</p>

<p>In using ammunition the B.E.F. put up some
startling records. On August 8th, 1918, when
our big final thrust began there were used
15,598 tons in a single day. On September
29th, 1918, there were used 23,706 tons. Here
are some other big figures:</p>

<p>In the depôts in France we kept a reserve of
258,000 tons of ammunition, and the issues in
a normal month ran to about that figure though
it varied a good deal month by month. Thus
the average expenditure during the last months
of 1918 was: May, 5,478 tons daily; June,
4,748 tons daily; July, 5,683 tons daily;
August, 9,046 tons daily; September, 8,576
tons daily; October, 4,748 tons daily; November,
3,158 tons daily. On November 11th, the last
day of the war, we used 233 tons of ammunition.</p>

<p>Different varieties of ammunition had widely
different rates of use. The gigantic 15-inch
howitzer on some days did not fire a single
round. It was a "big day" when it fired
fifty rounds. It was just as well that it was not
a gun which indulged in thousands of rounds,
for a ten-ton broad-gauge railway truck would
only take twelve rounds for it. The 18-pounder
field <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'gun'">guns</ins> would shoot 100,000 rounds on a
normal day, and on a heavy day would use
200,000 rounds. The cost of ammunition
was, in a time of heavy fighting, up to
£3,000,000 <i>per day</i>.</p>

<p>A heavy item in munitions was for defence
against poison gas and for our own poison gas
service. We entered with extreme reluctance
into the ghastly business, but once we started
we soon made the German sorry that he had
brought that element into the war. Our gases
were more potent and more plentiful than his.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
For lack of material he could not give his men
perfect gas protectors, while to our men we
could and did.</p>

<p>The last loathsome trick of the enemy in this
direction was the introduction of mustard gas,
a powerful corrosive which was discharged
from shells. The use of mustard gas by the
enemy raised a number of problems for Supplies
as apart from the Medical Staffs. The
disinfection with chloride of lime of ground
contaminated with the gas, a prompt change of
clothing and bath treatment for men affected,
proved efficacious in dealing with mustard gas.
There was, too, safety in protective overalls of
oilskin. Mustard gas affected the Veterinary
Service heavily, there being many casualties to
horses and mules through passing over ground
infected with the gas.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The inventive spirit was naturally strong in
the Army, and some of the most useful of the
new ideas in the way of munitions or equipment
came from men in the Field. These ideas
were tested in the Army workshops, and
occasionally there was a certain amount of
waste owing to the same idea, or nearly
the same idea, being experimented with
simultaneously in more than one Army. So an
Army Order from Home recalled the King's
Regulation that War Office approval must be
obtained before experimental work was done in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
regard to any invention. But this, it was
urged from G.H.Q., would act prejudicially to
the interests of the Force in France, since
many very useful inventions regarding stores
and material had come from officers and men
of the Force and it was not in the best interests
of the public to put any obstacles in the way of
future inventions. This was recognised, and
a subsequent Army Order gave authority to the
Commander-in-Chief of any Expeditionary
Force to authorise trials of inventions; but
precautions were taken in regard to duplication
and overlapping.</p>

<p>There were not in the Field so many foolish
inventors as at Home. No such merry idea
came to G.H.Q. as that anti-submarine device
with which the Admiralty was plagued&mdash;a
liquid air shell which on being exploded anywhere
in the vicinity of a submarine formed
an extensive iceberg (through the lowering of
the surrounding temperature by a release of the
liquid air from pressure). On this iceberg the
submarine would be brought to the surface.
The next step would be easy: open with an
oyster knife, sprinkle with pepper and salt and
a dash of lemon juice, and serve.</p>

<p>The B.E.F. had never anything quite so naive
as that. Its limit was the inventor who claimed
to be able to project an X-ray from an electric
battery so that it would kill anything within
1,000 yards. This invention would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
a great war-stopper. It would have been only
necessary to set up a sufficient number of the
projectors along our Front, switch on the
current and march on to Berlin. It was offered
at a time when inventions were rather the
fashion, and it needed courage to scoff at even
the most curious notion. So it actually got to
the stage of a trial with a High Authority
present. The inventor set up his projector; an
animal was let loose within its deadly
range and, surely enough, dropped dead.
Unfortunately for the inventor a medical scoffer
subjected the animal to a <i>post mortem</i> examination
and found that it had evidently resolved on
suicide, for it had taken a large dose of
strychnine. This discouraged further trials of
the X-ray device.</p>

<p>The inventor with a "wireless" device for
exploding enemy magazines also cropped up.
You projected a wireless ray and it blew up a
dump. This invention could be very convincingly
demonstrated within your own lines.
All that was necessary was to provide in the
dump a certain amount of loose explosive, a
fulminate, and a receiver tuned to receive your
wireless message. We were not on sufficiently
good terms with the Germans to persuade them
to arrange their ammunition depôts in this way
for our convenience.</p>

<p>There was a close <i>liaison</i> kept up between the
B.E.F. and the Ministry of Munitions. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Mr. Winston Churchill was Minister of
Munitions he was over in France so frequently
that a small château was kept up for him at
G.H.Q. He was wont to come into the Officers'
Club for his meals. There was always an air
about him that he would have liked to be in the
jack-boots of his famous ancestor and give the
world a spectacle of another Marlborough
winning victories in Flanders.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h4>THE MEDICAL SERVICES.</h4>

<h4>The magic-workers of the war&mdash;Fighting the
Germans&mdash;Concerning the Victorian primness of
conversation and the present popularity of "v.d."
as a theme for small talk&mdash;The Army and "v.d."&mdash;The

<p>Probably more than half the men at G.H.Q.
had been "crocked" at one time or another
during the campaign, from wounds or one of
those fevers of the battlefield born of mud and
filth and fatigue. Some came to work on the
Staff whilst still under medical treatment, and
there was a local hospital at Montreuil which
was a boon to those out-patients needing
massage for their scars or quinine for their
fevers.</p>

<p>Apart from the doctors of this hospital only
the very big men of the medical services
appeared ever at G.H.Q. It was a pleasure
not easily won to persuade them to talk over
their work. But when they did talk, what
wonders they had to tell of!</p>

<p><a name="i_0121"></a></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 392px;">
<img src="images/page_0121.jpg" width="392" height="600" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">A BY-WAY</span>
</div>

<p>Socrates in prison, when the fetters were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
taken off his legs, as he rubbed them to make
the blood run freely again, speculated on how
pleasure always followed pain, so that the two
seemed to be linked together by some unbreakable
bond. One would like to hear Socrates
to-day, as his limb, injured in Flanders,
was rubbed back to usefulness, talking to his
masseur on the good that will follow the evil of
the Great War as surely as if the two had been
linked together and one was the consequence of
the other. Matter for a fine homily there from
the stubborn old hero with the divinely clear
mind!</p>

<p>Those optimists who thought that a new
heaven and a new earth would come at the end
of the war, and that even all politicians would
become sincere, alert, and vigorous in the
public service, were perhaps not reasonable and
may be disappointed in some measure; but no
one can observe closely the phenomena of the
war without being sure that from its sacrifices
and lessons much good will come. The dreadful
fire that had to be kindled to burn out the cancer
of Germanism burned out evil too in the nations
that were the instruments of vengeance. Peoples
who went into war iron will come out steel
ultimately; for the war, as well as being
preservative, will prove regenerative.</p>

<p>There is no better proof of this than in the
tale of our campaigns against the germs, those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
pitiless enemies who are always attacking
human content and happiness. It was a
wonderful part of the war, that defensive and
offensive against Disease, with its trench
systems which hold up foes whom we cannot
destroy with our present weapons; its Intelligence
Department, spying with a thousand
microscopes into the designs and dispositions of
the enemy; its clever diplomatic service, always
raising up allies in our blood against germ
invasion; its long illustrious roll of heroes
who have given up life or health to hold
positions against odds or to go out on forlorn
hopes.</p>

<p>In this the benefits springing out from the
Great War show splendid and palpable. In
the process of beating the Germans we made
such great advances in the war against the
germs that we greet peace as a definitely
healthier people, organised to save, in a
generation or two, for service in this world,
more than the total of all those who went to a
Higher Service from the fields of France and
Belgium.</p>

<p>Because the war has given a sounder
national discipline, because it has cleared so
many obstacles from the path of medical
organisation, the world's death-rate, according
to sound calculations, will in future years show
a substantial decrease. The toll taken by the
Germans will be more than made up by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
lives saved from the germs. The British
Medical Service, following in the path of the
victorious British Army, and wielding an
authority that it never knew before, carried on
a war against disease in Europe, Asia, and
Africa that is now saving thousands of lives,
and will save millions in the ultimate result.
Enteric, cholera, dysentery, scurvy, small-pox,
beri-beri, malaria, phthisis were fought successfully.
Even that national British disease,
rheumatism, was pushed back from some of its
trenches and compelled to surrender not a few
of its ridges.</p>

<p>Fascinating as a fairy tale, absorbing as a
good detective story, stimulating as the records
of a stubborn battle, will be the record of
British medical work in the Great War when it
comes to be written. It will not be a story
merely of drains and drugs and dressings, but
also of kindly amulets and beneficent golden
fishes; of wicked germs who chalk their throats
to deceive with soft talk little red corpuscles;
of fairy princes who destroy wicked enchantments
with spells from tiny glass tubes. Those
attentive gentlemen experimenting with neck
ribbons smeared with potent charms have not
come to their second childhood; they are on the
track of the perfect <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'cilicifuge'">cimicifuge</ins> which will keep
lice off the body and, keeping off lice, will reduce
the range of typhus and other diseases. A great
tank of little live fish sent out to a malaria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Front does not mean that we are relapsing into
the old Chinese school of medicine (which
prescribed a live mouse to be swallowed whole as
a remedy for one complaint), but that these
little fish love to eat the eggs of the anopheles
mosquito, which spreads malaria. It lays its
eggs in ponds; the fish eat the eggs; the eggs
don't hatch; the mosquitoes don't come; and
there is less malaria.</p>

<p>If your mind is more attracted by detective
stories than by fairy tales, turn to a
bacteriological laboratory and watch the
tracking down of the Hidden Hand that is
responsible for odious diseases; for example,
that one known popularly as spotted fever, a
very deadly disease of over-crowding. A
cunning criminal is the spotted fever germ,
and he has not yet been quite fully identified
and convicted. A victim of spotted fever has
in his throat and spinal fluid the causative
germ; but this germ hides behind a smoke cloud
of other germs and must be placed quite
definitely before it can be destroyed. It was
found that it is a germ shaped like a double
bean, that it is to be distinguished from other
germs of the same shape by the fact that its hide
is impervious to a certain stain which those
other germs will absorb. It was further found
that this spotted fever germ would not increase
and multiply at a warmth of 23 degrees C.,
whilst otherwise similar germs would. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
certain knowledge stopped for a time. Other
double-bean, non-staining, non-growing at 23
degrees C. germs existed, among whom the real
criminal lived and hid. Finally, four bad
brother germs were found and are now being
dealt with, and the disease is no longer a serious
menace.</p>

<p>The divine purpose for good that runs
stubbornly through life and has made it
impossible for the murderous German plans to
thrive in spite of all our neglects and
stupidities, crops up insistently in the story of
the British medical campaign in this war.
Thus, chlorine gas came into the field first as
the poison gas of the Germans; it remained in
the field on the British side chiefly as a means
for purifying water.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One interesting result of the war which we
noticed at G.H.Q. was the abandonment of the
Early Victorian primness in conversation in
England. Soldiers going home on leave noticed
it from 1916 onwards; and on the balance of the
evidence I do not think they were at all
responsible for it. They would go away from
Boulogne, after an extra careful bath and the
putting on of a clean tunic, with a steady
resolution to put away from their thoughts and
their tongues all the coarseness of the camp;
and find themselves at their first dinner party
in England tackled by some young lady in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
teens on the subject of lice; or by some matron
not yet in the thirties on the subject of venereal
disease at the Front. They would come back
often with a distinct feeling of shame-shock,
to welcome the comparative reticence of Mess
conversation.</p>

<p>It was my duty once to see the representative
of an organisation that wished to have lectures
delivered to all the soldiers on the subject of
"v.d." To my surprise the representative
proved to be a lady&mdash;and a young and
attractive lady at that. She plunged into her
subject without the least trace of embarrassment.
She wanted lectures, with pictures, in
every recreation hut of the B.E.F., France, and
was firm to brush away the objection that "the
men might not like it," and scornful of the
reservation that if the lectures were permitted
they were not to be "parade lectures," <i>i.e.</i>, the
men were not to be compelled to attend.</p>

<p>Finally, discovering that though the lady
wanted "pictures" she had not the pictures
but expected the Army to supply them, I took
refuge in a subterfuge. "Very sorry, very
sorry indeed, but there is no Vote out of which
we can get the pictures."</p>

<p>But the lady was insistent. She knew that
there were cinematographs provided for the
soldiers.</p>

<p>"Oh, but that is not my department. That
is Amusements."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very well," she said firmly. "I'll see
Amusements."</p>

<p>And she went away to convince some other
Staff Officer that universal lectures on v.d.,
with pictures, would be an appreciated Amusement.</p>

<p>I do not know where the idea sprang from that
v.d. was very common in the Army. So far as
my observation went, and from what inquiries I
made of medical officers, the opposite was the
case. Among the officers with whom I came into
touch during the campaign&mdash;many hundreds in
the aggregate&mdash;I only heard of one case.
Among the men of my battery before I was on
the Staff I never heard of one case during 18
months of regimental life.</p>

<p>The Army's standard of health in this respect
was better than that of the average of the
civilian population. There were some tragic
outbreaks&mdash;one in Cairo, another (of much less
seriousness) with Amiens as its focus&mdash;but on
an average the record was good.</p>

<p>British ideas did not favour the degrees of
regulation and interference in this matter that
other countries tolerate. But the soldier had
some safeguards which the civilian had not.
For instance it was the duty of the Assistant
Provost Marshal of a Division, whenever a man
reported sick from v.d., to go to the hospital,
interview the patient and try to find out the
<i>fons et origo</i>. If his mission were successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the person responsible was promptly expelled
from the Army area.</p>

<p>One of the Dominion Corps adopted the
method of advising prophylactic precautions
(and supplying the means of prophylaxis). The
British Army on a whole did not follow that
course, though in the later stages of the
campaign the means of prophylaxis were
available if applied for.</p>

<p>But enough on that point. It was the surgical
rather than the medical side of the R.A.M.C.
that interested G.H.Q. So many had "taken
a knock" and put in a spell at a hospital.
Opinion was practically unanimous that
"Hospital" was a place of real human
sympathy as well as devoted skill, and that
"sister" was the best pattern of womankind.</p>

<p>It is etiquette in the Army to call her always
"Sister," though technically "sister" is an
intermediate grade between "nurse" and
"matron." Matron is a great dignitary. She
has, in the language of the Bar, "taken silk,"
and when her silk gown rustles into the room
it is etiquette for officers to stand up, provided
they have legs and strength to stand up. Otherwise
you "come to attention" by smiling as
well as you can; a respectful, cheerful, but not
an hilarious or free-and-easy smile. It should
convey the message that you are having the time
of your life in the best possible of hospitals
under the best possible of matrons. The Sister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
whose patient you are will be very much hurt if
you do not smile properly at Matron. "Sister"
is of many different grades of skill, but of an
almost unvarying grade of devotion, the
highest.</p>

<p>A "strafer," in hospital language, is a
Sister who by ten years or so of hard anxious
work and self-denial has reached to the height
of an office boy's wage and a professional skill
which saves lives daily and cuts weeks off one's
stay in hospital. You are always glad when
she has gone away from your wound, but at the
back of your gladness is the knowledge that you
want her for next dressing. A good "strafer"
goes over a wound with the enthusiasm of a
thrush with a large family going over a lawn
for worms. She examines, searches, squeezes,
probes, looking out for shed pieces of bone, for
"proud flesh," for odd corners where inflammatory
matter might lurk. She is looking for
mischief, and any mischief found is promptly
"strafed." If it is bad she calls in the
doctor; if it is minor she has her own little
armoury of mischief-breakers, scissors, pincers,
nitrate of silver, and the like.</p>

<p>Matrons are easily offended. At a certain
hospital in France the King was half expected
as a visitor. The Matron at once had a bad
attack of decoration fever. As I was a lightly-wounded
that time I assisted her policy of
deceiving his Majesty into thinking that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
hospital was always a fairy bower by going
out and "finding" some flowers. Then
Matron had clean quilts on all the beds, and the
order went forth that these were to be kept
creaseless and smooth. But one patient would
persist in crooking up his knees. Matron
argued with him. He disloyally pleaded that
he was much more comfortable that way. Now,
having got the flowers for the ward, I thought I
had the right to give advice as a sort of
accomplice, and I suggested mildly: "Better
break his knees, Matron."</p>

<p>She was offended. Then the King did not
come after all; and I think she was inclined to
blame me for that.</p>

<p>But matrons are not altogether an evil; like
the Staff and adjutants and brigade majors,
they are at the worst necessary evils, at the best
quite good sorts. But there is one matron-habit
that should be dealt with sternly by
regulation. If a very pretty nurse were posted
to a hospital, Matron generally tried to assign
her to the sick sisters' ward. Obviously that
was bad strategy. The prettiness of their
nurse would have no cheering effect on sick
sisters, but to sick officers a pretty sister
irresistibly suggests the wisdom of getting well
quickly. Fortunately the supply of pretty
sisters is too great to allow of their all being
absorbed in wards for sick sisters.</p>

<span class="caption">A ROYAL VISIT, DECEMBER 1918</span>
</div>

<p>What reconciles one to Matron is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
discovery sooner or later that, despite silk gown
and awe-inspiring manner, she is at heart
still "Sister," ready with skilful aid and
encouraging sympathy in case of need. It is a
nice etiquette that makes the title "Sister"
general, for it is just sisterly affection which
makes the atmosphere of a military hospital so
cheering and recreating.</p>

<p>Distinctions of rank are abrogated in a
military hospital to a large extent. The officer
of general rank has a special quarter where he
meets only other highnesses; but, for the rest,
colonel and "pip-squeak" (the odious term
which is vainly designed to lessen the self-importance
of the second lieutenant) usually
fraternise in a common cheerfulness. There
are no rank badges on pyjamas. But one
distinction has intruded&mdash;that between surgical
cases and medical cases. The medical case
must bear himself very humbly if he gets into a
ward where there are surgical cases. Even
that kindly authority "Sister" will in some
unguarded moment, unless she is very, very
careful, refer to him as "<i>only</i> a medical case."</p>

<p>One medical case, taught cunning by circumstances,
discovered when he was being moved
from one hospital to another that a special sort
of headache he suffered from could be relieved by
a large, impressive bandage. With this head
adornment he successfully deceived us at &mdash;&mdash;
Hospital. A rumour went around that he was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
trepanned case, and as Rumour stalked from
bed to bed the size of the silver plate in his skull
grew and grew until it was almost the size of a
dinner plate. His shameful secret was at length
discovered; he was only a fever or a heart or
something, and, whilst we were all sorry for
him, he no longer disputed favour with our
ward pet&mdash;a delightfully cheerful pip-squeak
whose body was so be-stitched that we felt sure
they had a sewing machine in the operating

<p>It is etiquette in a military hospital to be
very much interested in one's neighbour's
wounds and to affect to hold lightly one's own.
It is very bad form to hint that your lot is more
severe than his lot.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am all right, thanks," (you say in
answer to his first advances); "except for a bit
of my liver and a few yards of lung blown away,
I'm as fit as can be. But that looks an awful
leg of yours."</p>

<p>"Not at all, not at all. It is almost certain
now to stay on. But it must be horribly
interesting to have a body wound."</p>

<p>And so the ghoulish chat goes on.</p>

<p>Quite half of G.H.Q. had hospital
reminiscences to exchange; indeed a spell in
hospital with a bad wound was often the
clinching argument leading to "red tabs" if
an officer were qualified for the distinction; and
Medical Boards in England were quite willing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
to certify a man as fit for France if he was
marked for a Staff Appointment even though
his category was "light duty."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Trench Feet" gave the Medical Services
more trouble than any other single disease, and
almost as much trouble as the shells of the
enemy. In the winter of 1915 a pilgrim to
Flanders (supposing him to have a military
permit) might have observed in the rest camps
behind the British lines companies of men with
bare feet, and officers bending down anointing
them. And he might have perhaps concluded
that this was some religious ritual of humiliation,
such as the theatrical washing of beggars'
feet by the late Austrian Emperor once a year.
But such a conclusion would have been wrong.
The proceeding was religious certainly, in the
highest sense, but in no way theatrical. It
was "Trench Feet" treatment.</p>

<p>The disease known as "Trench Feet" was
one of the most serious developments which the
Army on the Western Front had to face when
the Germans, beaten in the field, "dug in,"
and Trench War began. The struggle with
the disease was a long and strenuous one, taxing
to the utmost the resources of the British Army
Medical Service.</p>

<p>The causes of the disease were not plain at the
outset, and inquiry proved them to be various.
Everybody knows that it is uncomfortable and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
to a certain extent, unhealthy to stand for too
long at a time. (The social legislation that
shop employees must be allowed seats is an
indication of this). The soldier in the trenches
must often stand for long periods. That makes
him to some extent liable to foot trouble.
Again, tight boots and tight bandages round
the legs are bad for the blood circulation, and
can make foot trouble without any other cause.
The soldier used to be rather careless as to
whether his boots were of a proper fit, and he
was apt to bind his puttees too tightly.</p>

<p>Here were the beginnings of "Trench Feet."
To have the feet wet, to have the feet cold for
long spells, will cause chilblains, <i>i.e.</i>, local
inflammations showing first as red itching
lumps, afterwards if neglected, developing into
open sores. Long periods of standing, and any
constriction of the circulation from tight boots
or tight puttees, help cold and damp to cause
chilblains; and chilblains used to be almost
invariably neglected by the soldier. Then came
the final aggravating cause&mdash;the filth of the
Flanders mud getting into the sores of the
broken chilblains, and, behold, a typical case of
Trench Feet.</p>

<p>In the early days cases were often of dreadful
severity, sometimes leading to amputation.
In one of my billets at Montreuil was a French
soldier who had lost both his feet from this
cause. Later, both treatment of the disease and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
more important, the prevention of it, were so
perfected that really bad cases were rare.</p>

<p>The story of the fight against "Trench Feet"
is one of the many fine stories of the war. In
the main it was, of course, a story of medical
skill and devotion, but also it was a story of
unstinted generosity on the part of the War
Office, and of admirable and intelligent service
on the part of regimental officers. The medical
staff told me that it would have been impossible
to carry on to success the campaign against
"Trench Feet" if they had not been
intelligently and perseveringly backed up by
regimental officers, and if the War Office had
not poured out very many thousands of pounds
sterling for the furtherance of every approved
preventive measure.</p>

<p>Preventive measures covered a wide field;
precautions against tight boots and tight
puttees; increased provisions of socks; increased
bathing facilities; provision of waterproof
rubber boots for men while in the trenches (these
boots were of the high wader type); paving of
the trenches with "duck-boards" which gave a
dry standing; more frequent reliefs in wet
trenches. These were material provisions. To
second them there was an active propaganda
in personal hygiene, and here the regimental
officer and non-commissioned officer were enlisted
to help the medical staff to make the men understand
that the smallest sign of a chilblain was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
to be met with prompt treatment. A whale oil
ointment was provided both as a prophylactic
and as a curative for mild chilblains. When
necessary this was reinforced by spirituous
lotions. On officers was put the responsibility
of seeing that their men's feet were kept clean
and well anointed with oil, and that any breach
of the skin tissue was promptly treated. So
officers became chiropodists, and you might see
enthusiastic company commanders assisting
their men to wash and anoint their feet, to show
them how it should be done.</p>

<p>The winter of 1917-1918 put to a severe test
the precautions against "Trench Feet," for in
almost every part of the Western Front the
British had pushed the Germans back, and
there was no longer the old organised trench
system. Nevertheless the British hospital
records show that the disease was held. It was
still a trouble; but, thanks to the plentiful
supply of comforts and preventatives, and to
the scrupulous care demanded by regimental
and medical officers, it was no longer a grave
menace.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The fight against mustard gas in 1918 was
another fine achievement of the Medical
Services. But this subject of the medicine of
the war calls for a volume to itself. Let me
only add here that the successful medical results
won in this war were largely due to the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
that&mdash;contrary to the system of other wars&mdash;the
doctor had a real influence and power at
G.H.Q. In his own department he was
supreme. So were solved successfully the vast
medical problems which the Great War presented.
The greatest armies known to history
grappled in a continuous and furious struggle,
not for a day or a night or a week, but for
months. The wounds caused by hand grenades
and high explosive shells were often of terrible
extent. The battlefield to a depth of five miles
was under constant shell fire, and transport of
the wounded for that distance was therefore
always under fire, and roads were torn up
almost as soon as made. Conditions of infection
were extraordinarily favourable. Traffic
regulation had to overcome the most serious
obstacles, since railways, roads and tracks had
to provide for the constant reinforcements, for
the frequent passage to and fro of relieving
Divisions, for food and water for men and
horses, and also for ammunition unprecedented
in quantity.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h4>THE ANIMALS OF THE FORCE.</h4>

<h4>A happy lot&mdash;The mud season in Flanders&mdash;The
effects of mustard gas&mdash;The character of the mule&mdash;Forage
difficulties&mdash;The French object to our
horse ration&mdash;The Americans side with us&mdash;The
animal record in 1918.</h4>


<p>No two officials at G.H.Q. had a better right
to be proud of their departments than the
Director of Veterinary Services (Major-General
Moore) and the Director of Remounts (Brigadier-General
Sir F. S. Garratt). These two were
responsible for the welfare of the half million
animals of the B.E.F., and there was never a
collection of war animals that had a better time.</p>

<p>It was a commonplace of German criticism
of Great Britain's military position before
1914 that the possibilities of a big quickly-trained
British Army were negligible, because,
whilst rank and file might be raised quickly
enough, three things could not be improvised in
a hurry: knowledge of staff work, of gunnery,
and of horse-mastery. The German now knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
that he was wrong, and in no particular was he
more wrong than in regard to horse-mastery.
It is admitted over all the Continent of Europe
that horse-mastery in the "improvised"
British Army reached the highest standard of
the campaign.</p>

<p>In this matter the horse markets of Europe
spoke after the Armistice with no uncertain
voice. When the British Army was disposing
of its superfluous horses, everybody rushed to
buy them. Prices touched a truly extraordinary
level. The unhappy taxpayer amid all his
burdens saw a golden stream flowing into the
Treasury, because his Army was a humane,
conscientious, and skilful horsemaster. The
military advantage to transport through
keeping the Army's animals fit and well is so
obvious that it need not be dwelt upon. The
advantage to the <i>morale</i> of the men is not so
generally appreciated, but was none the less
real. It helped to keep our men in good heart
that the animals who worked with them, and
for them, were in good heart and condition. To
British men with their fine tradition of
humanity to animals it would have been
demoralising to have seen their brutes hungry
and suffering. Finally, the world markets
came forward with their evidence that the
British Army policy of kindness to its animals
was not only good for transport and good for
<i>morale</i> but also good for business.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>By the Spring of 1919 we had sold out of the
Army 252,676 animals (horses and mules), of
which 235,715 were sold for work and 16,961
for meat. The total realised was £8,493,920,
of which £8,081,607 was realised from the
working animals and £412,313 for those
animals which, because of old age or disablement,
it was more merciful to send to the
slaughter-house. In addition a small item of
£18,696 had been realised from by-products,
for our Army administrators, whatever might
be thought to the contrary, did study economy,
and the animal which fell by the wayside was
usually put to some use. At least its hide was
saved, and, if transport were available, its fat
and bones also figured in a "salvage" return.</p>

<p>This money was mostly foreign money, too.
It was the policy of the Army not to
"profiteer" in the United Kingdom. Indeed,
within our home borders it was rather to help
the small farmer with cheap animals than to
seek to get the best out of the market.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The mobilisation of the horse strength of
Great Britain in 1914 was wonderfully assisted
by the willing and instructed patriotism of
farmers, landowners, and hunting men. It
yielded far better results than were anticipated.
One calculation makes it that 17 per cent. of the
total civilian horse strength of the country was
mobilised.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>But, of course, there was a tremendous gap
between this result and the needs of the New
Armies. A wise prescience at the very outset
decided to reinforce horse strength with mule
strength. Before the end of 1914 mules
imported from abroad were being tried as
substitutes for horses in the Army. Some of
the experiments did not give promising results.
The mule, for example, did not prove possible
in gun teams. But it established itself in a
very wide range of general utility and
materially helped to win the war.</p>

<p>The improvisation of remount depôts and of
training centres for horses and for men who
for the first time had to handle horses was the
first big problem. The winter of 1914-15 was
a hard time. But extraordinary results were
won by the cordial co-operation of the
"horsey" men of the country. The hunting,
coaching, and racing stables were great pillars
of strength. By the spring of 1915 the position
in the United Kingdom was good.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1915-16 most of the difficulty
had to be faced by the B.E.F., France. We
had a great concentration of troops in Flanders.
The mounted units were made up in the main
of men new to horse-management. The animals
had to be nursed through a winter in what was
the wickedest country conceivable for horses.
Stable accommodation was, of course, absent.
Not 1 per cent. could be housed in existing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
stables. Labour and material were lacking for
the building of new stables. Most of the
animals spent the winter in the open. The mud
was a cruel enemy. In that highly manured
country a horse standing out in the mud had its
hoofs attacked at once. A "greasy heel"
soon became a purulent sore.</p>

<p>The "Mud Season" opens in Flanders in
October and lasts until June; and Flanders mud
has a body and aroma all its own. A great
French Marshal of a by-gone age committed
himself without reserve to the opinion that
"Flanders was no place to fight in." Thomas
Atkins, as he pushed obstinately and irresistibly
through the mud towards some pill-box
objective, has endorsed that high strategical
judgment. Perhaps in a future war, if there is
going to be a future war, Flanders will be a
closed area and no Army will be allowed to go
there to fight under penalty of a <i><ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'procés-verbal'">procès-verbal</ins></i>.
That should be done if only for the sake of the
horses.</p>

<span class="caption">THE EAST RAMPARTS</span>
</div>

<p>As every civilian stay-at-home knows, the
Army is an entirely foolish organisation with
no knowledge of practical affairs. But I doubt
whether any civil organisation would have
carried the same number of horses through the
same conditions with the same small percentage
of losses. The Army did not tackle the problem
in any hide-bound way. A good deal was left
to the initiative and enthusiasm of individual
officers. Some general principles were set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
down. Within the boundaries of those
principles there was wide scope for personal
ingenuity, and as the good thing that one
officer worked out soon became the property of
all the Division, a very high standard of horse-management
was reached.</p>

<p>Will it shock some old retired officers to hear
that authority, the highest authority, abolished
the clipping of horses that year in Flanders?
Horse-clipping was once a sacred institution,
with its fixed dates and ritual, in the Army.
That year in Flanders horse-clipping was
abolished, and the horses became wild and
woolly but withal happy. I used to love to see
their flowing locks streaming in the cold wind
as they stood out in the lines, coated like
St. Bernard dogs, and quite comfortable.
"Stables" became more arduous as horse-coats
became longer, but the horses flourished in
the open with just break-winds, and sometimes
thatch rain-shelter overhead. I would never
want to see a finer lot of horses than those of the
early Spring of 1916. They were hairy and
they were lean, and they would eat their nosebags,
if given a minute's grace after the feed
was finished; but they were full of heart and of
work.</p>

<p>The enemy was the mud. We found that if
the horses were given good standings and their
feet kept out of the mud the rain did not trouble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
them at all, and the wind troubled them little.
But once off the pavé roads all Flanders was
semi-liquid, and the problem at horse-lines was
first to secure a solid "standing," next to
secure a solid road in and out to that
standing, and finally to secure a solid road
to and from a solid watering place. A
unit that built for its horses elegant brick
standings in the middle of a field, and forgot
the rest, found after the first rain that its lines
were surrounded by a sea of mud. Then the
horses had to be given temporary refuge in the
paved street of an evacuated town, whilst a
saddened unit faced scorn and obloquy and the
necessity of constructing another brick standing
on another site, <i>not</i> an island site this time.</p>

<p>Standings were usually made of bricks, and
the Army requisitioned all the brick yards in
the occupied area. Shell-ruined villages were
another source of brick supply. Rubble brick
was of no use for standings; the bricks had to
be set properly; rubble was lost in the soil
within a day. One officer got excellent results
by preparing a well-sloped bed; enclosing it
with great logs, treating it with a thin layer of
straw, and close-setting the bricks over that.
It seemed a poor use to put straw to, but that
stand lasted out the winter wonderfully well.</p>

<p>The difficulty of getting good accessible
watering places was very great. Water, of
course, there was in abundance, but the horses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
would ordinarily have to go up to their bellies
in mud to get at it. To set up troughs accessible
by some firm road was necessary, and the site of
the troughs had to be soundly paved. One
Pioneer officer settled his watering problem
ingeniously. He had secured a pump and some
hose, and he sank a little well just on the edge
of his horse-lines, and was able to water by
troughs set up on the brick standing. Watering
by bucket was forbidden except on the road, for
the reason that there was never any certainty
by bucket watering that a horse would get
enough to drink, and a horse kept short of water
for long is soon a lost horse.</p>

<p>Losses from enemy action were not very high
among the horses until the last phase. There
was, on the whole, little cavalry work except at
the end of the campaign and at its very
beginning. Our air supremacy usually saved
horse-lines in the rear of our lines from very
severe shelling. But horse and mule losses
increased greatly when the enemy began to use
mustard gas. That proved deadly to animals.
The ground where a mustard gas shell had
fallen was infected for many hours afterwards.
If horses were picketed on it, or even passed
over it, casualties were high. The irritant
poison of the gas attacked their skins wherever
the hair was thin, and caused the most dreadful
wounds. Precaution, however, was prompt,
and an effective curative treatment was found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
in a dressing, the chief ingredient of which
was chloride of lime.</p>

<p>From the spring of 1918 the British Army
horse had to suffer severe attacks from the air.
We had by then established a very great
transport superiority, and the enemy devoted a
good deal of his air strength to bombing attacks
on our horse-lines, with a view to lessening our
transport strength. At first these attacks were
very deadly. But the position was soon met.
Horse-lines were cleverly concealed. The
animals were separated into small groups.
The lines were protected by bomb-proof
traverses of earthwork, which localised the
effects of explosions.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1918 the wastage of animals
had been cut down to the lowest percentage
reached in the whole campaign. This meant
that battle losses were being compensated for by
a very low sickness rate, achieved by careful and
skilful horse-mastership. The British Army,
which had been always an army of horse-lovers,
was now also an Army of skilled horse-masters,
and in spite of bombing raids, of long-distance
shelling, and of poison gas, the death rate kept
dwindling. At this time forage difficulties
were acute, but there had been close organisation
to grow fodder in Army and Line of
Communication areas, and our animals always
had a decent ration.</p>

<p>But it was through the unsparing work of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the men, with brain and hand, that the horses
were so happily situated. The public at Home
can never express sufficient gratitude for that
work&mdash;work which had little glamour or hope
of reward, but which was as necessary to victory
as that of rifleman and gunner.</p>

<p>The final triumph of our Army horse
administration was in the summer of 1918,
when it was able to take up a big part of the
burden of horsing the American units arriving
in France. That, again, was a factor of
victory. Without transport or gun-horses the
American troops could not have given their
magnificent help in the last stages of the
campaign.</p>

<p>In the sum the story of the British Army
horse in the Great War is a thrilling one.
Our Home horse-lovers opened the chapter
gloriously. The British Navy followed up by
making it possible to transport remounts from
all parts of the world. Then the men of the Old
Army and of the New Armies showed what
grit and resource and kindness could do. So
we rode home to victory.</p>

<p>The record of the animals of the B.E.F.
should do something to dissipate the marked
prejudice against the mule in Great Britain.
People here do not understand its virtues as a
draught animal. Granted that the mule is not
suitable for heavy draught work and may prove
a serious nuisance on a farm if it cannot be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
kept within its proper bounds&mdash;for a mule has
an omnivorous appetite&mdash;still there is a very
wide field of usefulness for this animal in city
work, such as bread and milk and parcel
carriage and light van work generally; also as
a transport animal for the small farmer. The
mule eats much less than the horse, has a longer
working life, is less liable to disease, needs
less attention. The mule's rough commonsense,
which teaches him to be very careful of himself,
is a positive advantage. Given decent treatment,
a mule is a reliable, good-natured, and
likeable animal. He has not the same charming
manners as a well-trained horse, but he has
plenty of character, and it is mostly good
character.</p>

<p>The wicked mule does exist, but he is the
exception, not the rule. One champion wicked
mule I can recall. He was as big as a horse,
black in colour, and on the near side had a
blood-shot fiery eye which was a good danger
signal. On the off-side he had a white eye.
This was a deceptive white-flag signal, for the
beast kicked with equal viciousness on both
sides. Likewise he bit from all points of the
compass. The one thing that soured his life
was the fact that he couldn't sting with his tail.
To groom Belial&mdash;that was his name&mdash;he had to
be put in slings. But he was an easy animal to
shoe. Hold a shoe with the nails fixed in the
proper position, and the animal would attach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
itself firmly to the shoe with one kick. An
occasional Belial excepted, the mules were a
pleasant lot.</p>

<p>The mule is a hard worker but a sensible
worker. He will not try to overtax his
strength, and he goes on strike firmly if asked
to do too much. "I may be a bit of an ass,"
the animal tells you, "but none of this heroic
business of the Arab steed breaking his heart
with a mighty effort for <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>This attitude is not poetic, but it is practical.
And the mule compensates by standing mud
better, eating less, and putting up with poorer
food than the horse. The mule, however, is
very particular about what he drinks. Water
that the horse will swallow greedily the mule
will turn up his Roman nose at. If you are
watering mules and horses at the same stream,
the mules must have first drink, for they will not
touch the muddied water, though horses have
no objection to it.</p>

<p>G.H.Q. during the last stages of the
campaign had a hard task to keep the animals
of the B.E.F. properly fed. At the outset of
the War the horse ration erred, if anything,
on the generous side, and a good deal of it
wandered into the mangers of the civilian
animals of the country, much to their contentment.
As the war dragged its exhausting
length along, money became scarce, food
supplies scarcer still, and transport facilities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
scarcest of all. Then the ration of the animals
had to be cut to a point which represented just
sufficient and nothing more. Even so, it was a
much better ration than the French gave their
horses, and there were repeated efforts by the
French Authorities to persuade us to come down
to their animal ration. Those efforts naturally
had a much greater chance of success when the
union of the command made Marshal Foch the
Generalissimo of all the Armies in France.</p>

<p>But our High Command was stubborn in its
championship of the animals. There was a
very strong representation of the cavalry on the
Staff; and, besides, the British as a race have
a sentiment about animals which is not shared
to the full by the Latin races. The average
British soldier would as soon go short of food
himself as see his animals hungry. At one time
the British War Cabinet yielded to the strong
representations that were being made that the
British Army wasted resources and transport in
its feeding of the animals, and ordered a heavy
reduction of the horse ration. Even then the
British Command in the Field did not give up
the cause for lost, continued to argue the matter,
and by pointing out that a vast amount of extra
work was just then being thrown upon the
animals by the reduction of Field Artillery
ammunition teams from six horses to four,
secured a compromise decision which made a
much smaller reduction in the ration.</p>

<p><a name="i_0157"></a></p>

<span class="caption">THE ARMY COMMANDERS</span>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>The French Authorities without a doubt
honestly believed they were in the right and
that we were "coddling" our brutes, for they
made another effort to get "unity of animal
ration" as a kind of logical sequel to "unity
of command." This time they made an
agreement with the Americans that the latter
should come down to their scale of animal
ration. Without a full knowledge of what
they were doing, the Americans agreed at
first; and it looked as if the British horse
also would have to have his ration reduced.
But with more complete knowledge of the
facts the American Army reversed its previous
decision and decided that it could not come
down below the British animal ration. A
whinny of joy would have gone round the
British horse lines at this decision if it had
been promulgated in horse language, for it
saved the situation. I am honestly of opinion
that it had its effect, too, in bringing the
campaign to its triumphant conclusion. In
the last stages between August and November,
1918, I do not think that the rapid pursuit of
the enemy would have been possible if the
horse ration had been reduced further than it
was in July, 1918. As it was, that reduction
put a stop to the decline in the sickness rate
and caused it to increase slightly.</p>

<p>G.H.Q. did its best to make up for the
reduced ration by organising local growth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
fodder crops wherever there was a chance, and
there was instituted an Inspectorate of Horse
Feeding and Economies. The I.Q.M.G.S. had
to oversee all animals, except those on charge of
Director Remounts and Director Veterinary
Services, to advise on all matters of forage, to
seek means of economy and generally to supervise
the "horse-mastery" of units.</p>

<p>Horse-masters can best judge the rights of the
fodder position for themselves by noting the
actual animal ration. Taking an average of
25,000 horses, light <i>and</i> heavy, the weight of
the rations at the time of the controversy was:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Rations for horses">
<tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="right">lbs.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left">American</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="right">23.6</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left">British</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="right">22.2</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left">French</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="right">16.1</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Twenty-two pounds weight of food per day
is not excessive for a horse doing hard work;
and that was the <i>average</i>. After the heavy
horses had their higher ration the light horses
had to be content with less.</p>

<p>Probably the French never saw our point of
view and suspected that there was not much
more than English obstinacy in this determined
stand for the welfare of the dumb beasts. But
the controversy was carried on with good
humour all the same, and in the end "those
curious English" had their own way.</p>

<p>Whenever questions such as this arose
between the Allied Forces it proved in practice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
that the Americans usually had the deciding
voice. Perhaps it may be recorded without
hurting anyone's feelings that the American
as a matter of instinct was inclined usually to
take the French side, because his stronger
sympathy was in that direction; after
experience he was inclined usually to take the
British side, for his manner of thinking was
more on our lines.</p>

<p>The animal record for the last year of the
war was a fine one. The sickness rate was
brought down to a figure practically as low as
that of a big stable under peace conditions,
and this&mdash;the result of good horse-mastery&mdash;helped
to make up for battle casualties and
casualties from bombs. (It was in January,
1918, that the enemy first instituted a definite
policy of searching out our horse-lines and
subjecting them to aeroplane attack in order
to cripple our lines of supply). In June, 1918,
the sickness rate was actually lower than at any
period in the history of the force (7.7 per cent.
as against 12.05 per cent. in May, 1917). Losses
of animals in battle showed a marked reduction.
The general reduction in losses was partly due
to a decrease in the losses from enemy bombs,
as a great deal of work had then been done to
conceal and protect horse-lines from aircraft
attack.</p>

<p>In July, 1918, the horse situation was even
better, and the sickness rate for the month was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
7.5 per cent. (compared with 7.7 per cent. in
June and 8.73 per cent. in May). Unfortunately
it was necessary that month to reduce the hay
ration by one lb. per day. (A more considerable
reduction proposed was abandoned, as I have
pointed out). The shortage in the supply of
animals as compared with requirements, a
shortage principally due to the needs of the
new American units, was met by various
expedients. Nearly 25,000 animals were made
available by reductions of the horse strength of
artillery units. A further 14,000 were saved
by giving 6-inch howitzer and some 60-pounder
batteries mechanical transport. Another means
of economy in horse-flesh was worked out&mdash;the
setting up of a "Category B" in animals.
Those which were not quite fit for arduous
work with a fighting unit were withdrawn to
units whose demands on them were less
exacting.</p>

<p>In August, 1918, when our great attack
began, the animals with the Force had heavy
losses. Battle casualties were high, partly
because of the large employment of cavalry,
partly because of the intensive war from the air
against horse-lines. The precautions against
this kind of attack which we had developed
could not be kept up during the rapid advance,
and horses in the fighting line suffered severely
from bombs as well as shell fire. But that was
part of the necessary price of victory. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
was a matter for real regret, however, was the
increase in the sick rate which accompanied the
revival of intensive operations. We all felt
sorry that the forage ration had been reduced,
even though slightly, for there was reason to
think that even this slight reduction in the
forage ration had made it impossible in some
cases to keep the animals up to the best
standard of condition. Very hard work was
being done on a ration which was cut very fine.</p>

<p>After November 11th, when the Armistice was
signed, our animal sickness rate was only 9 per
cent., and later, as we began to sell off our
animals, the advantage of humane treatment
told in the market rates.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h4>THE FINANCIAL SERVICES.</h4>

<h4>The generosity of the British People&mdash;G.H.Q.
was not a spendthrift&mdash;The Pay system&mdash;Curiosities
of banking in the field&mdash;Claims of the
civilian inhabitants&mdash;The looted rabbit.</h4>


<p>The financial side of the B.E.F. was one of
the triumphs of G.H.Q. "Yes, in spending
money," someone may remark, thinking
gloomily over his Income Tax assessment. But
the triumph I refer to is in the dealing with
vast sums with so little loss from peculation or
from mistake.</p>

<p>An Army in the Field should not be pinched
for money if it is to work with confidence and
economy of life. Very often in the history of
war a "ragged Army" has done wonders, and
the praise of those wonders has led to some
minds confusing raggedness with heroism,
thinking that desperate impoverishment is a
good thing for an Army. It might have been
sometimes in the old days, when the sack of the
enemy's country was the reward of victory and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
it was a case of fight or perish. In modern
times it is a sound principle of warfare that the
better an Army is supplied with the means of
warfare the less will be the cost of life in
achieving its purpose.</p>

<p>The soldiers of the British Army in France
have reason to feel grateful to the people of
Great Britain that there was never any sparing
of money at the expense of their comfort and
safety. No Army at any known period of the
world's history was more lavishly provided for
in food, clothing, munitions and pay. To
illustrate on one point only, that of munitions.
In the British Army 100,000 men in a day used
410 tons of munitions, in the French Army the
same number of men in a day used 246 tons.
Part of the disparity might be accounted for
by superior economy on the part of the French.
Most of it was due to the fact that the British
people were able to supply, and did supply,
their troops with far greater quantities of shell,
etc., so as to take as much of the burden of war
as possible off the flesh and blood of the soldier.</p>

<p>The taxpayer for his part can be comforted
with the knowledge that, so far as the Army in
the Field was concerned, there was an honest
effort to guard against waste. Of course war
is a wasteful business, essentially, and no
possible precaution can guard against some
losses. Often the position is that a great
amount of material has to be devoted to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
certain purpose though it is very likely to be
wasted, because the alternative is to incur a
greater risk of life. It was always the British
system, a system which Parliament insisted
upon equally with the Generals in the Field,
that any sacrifice of money and material was to
be preferred to a useless sacrifice of life.</p>

<p>In peace times the Finance Branch of the
War Office had a long-standing reputation for
artful meanness. It was accused of working on
the principle that an officer in the Army was
always possessed of abundant private means
and therefore never really wanted any Army
money, and that a private soldier was clearly a
fool and a failure for being in the Army
at all and therefore deserved little or no
consideration. If he were allowed money to
spare he would waste it on dissipation.</p>

<p>Certainly F. Branch War Office showed itself
time and again very sharp at construing the
Pay Warrant to the benefit of the Treasury,
but it was never quite as bad as that. In the
Field the spirit of economy had to give place to
the spirit of efficiency and of <i>morale</i>. Nevertheless,
a very tight check was kept on
the money-bags to prevent dishonesty or
extravagance. The Financial Adviser at
G.H.Q. was a potentate of great ability and of
enormous authority. No order which involved
the spending of money could go out without
being referred to him and winning his approval.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
He had the right of access to the Commander-in-Chief
at all times. It was said that since
as a civilian he did not get prompt and full
respect from sentries, or from officers who did
not understand his position as Chancellor of the
Army Exchequer, he was made a General in a
single day, and that when he first walked
abroad as a General and sentries presented arms
to him he was greatly perturbed, thinking that
this might be the first step in an outbreak of
personal violence. But that was by way of
<i>persiflage</i>. All officers who came into contact
with him recognised a man of ability and of
sympathy.</p>

<p>It was the Army Pay Department that most
closely touched the lives of the soldiers in
France. It had to pay a total of about two and
a half million people of all kinds&mdash;officers who
were either affluent or careful and gave no
trouble at all; officers who were neither and
whose impecuniosity had to be guarded against;
a very few officers who were actually dishonest;
"other ranks" in whose pay there were infinite
complications due to separation allowances and
the like; and furthermore the women of the
various auxiliary corps, the Labour Corps of
various nationalities, civilian auxiliaries and
the like. As the war progressed "Pay" had
to act as money-changer, dealing with almost all
the currencies of the world, and as a Savings
Bank and as liquidator of all kinds of claims<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and as a third party in those highly convenient
transactions in which an officer bought clothes
and other necessities from "Ordnance" at a
price which was sometimes less than half that
charged by London stores.</p>

<p>The Army Pay Department in the Field was
not the final paymaster. It gave advances on
account only, leaving the final adjustment to the
Pay office at Home. But during the war
and up to the end of 1918 (by which time
demobilisation had broken up most of the units
in France) it had paid out nearly four
thousand million francs, and its total losses
from forgeries, war losses, bad money, etc.,
were quite insignificant. At one period in
1918 when an analysis was made, it was found
that the bad money passed off on to the Pay
Department had averaged only eight francs per
week.</p>

<p>The financial arrangements of the old Regular
Army had to be modified very considerably,
especially in regard to officers, as the war
continued, though at first an attempt was made
to apply them in their entirety. The Army Pay
Agents soon found out that a number of the new
officers who had come into the service had little
or no sense of financial responsibility, and the
Pay Department had to tighten the reins
considerably. Exceedingly liberal arrangements
had been made at the outset to meet the
convenience of officers. Thus any Branch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the Bank of France would cash an officer's
cheque up to £5, and any Field Cashier&mdash;each
Division had a Field Cashier&mdash;would cash his
chit to the same amount. Also, he might draw
his allowances by cheque monthly, and this
cheque was good at any Field Cashier's office.</p>

<p>Some early developments were startling.
There is a tale of one officer (he was in a position
which gave him a wide range of movement)
collecting £125 in one day before going on
leave. He had a "good leave" presumably,
but he had at the time only £3 due to him at his
Army Agent's, and it took some time for him to
make up the balance on his pay as lieutenant.
To meet the case of gentlemen "raising the
wind" on this scale there was instituted an
"Officer's Advance Book," the conditions of
obtaining and using which were gradually
tightened, so that it was only possible for an
officer below "field" rank to obtain three
advances in a month of 125 francs each. That
still left one loop-hole for improvidence or
dishonesty&mdash;cashing cheques at a Bank of
France after drawing the three advances. But
not very many officers could get to a bank except
during a "leave," and a certain "overrunning
of the constable" was expected then and
could be adjusted afterwards. Officers who
consistently drew beyond their means after
warning were looked upon as having dishonest
intentions and were put on a "black list."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
They could not draw cheques, and were
deprived of their "Advance Books" until they
were in credit again.</p>

<p>There was no serious amount of financial
delinquency. At the worst the "black list"
just crept over the 100 limit. One incorrigible
spendthrift, having been deprived of his
Advance Book, tried to obtain another from a
Field Cashier in another centre on the plea that
his previous book "had been captured by the
enemy."</p>

<p>It was very human, the Pay Department, for
all its strictness, and in my experience never
refused an officer who was going on leave a
"bit extra" if he had a good financial name.
One of its very kind customs was to arrange for
wounded officers evacuated to "Blighty" to be
met in England by Pay Agents who pressed on
them change of a little cheque to meet possible
incidental expenses in hospital. It had, too,
a nice habit of watching the tactical situation
and acting accordingly. After the great
German onrush of the Spring of 1918 many
hundreds of officers were destitute, their kits
abandoned to the enemy. Pay Department
promptly relaxed all its rules to enable them to
outfit again promptly; and, of course, there was
ultimately reimbursement to the officers of the
value of their kits. Up to the conclusion of the
war "Pay" reimbursed nearly 20,000 officers
for loss of kit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pay" changed any sort of money into
French currency; and it had to deal with many
varieties. Serbian, Egyptian, Nova Scotian,
Greek, Kruger money (from South Africa),
Australian bank notes, Italian, Russian,
American, Canadian, local French "Bank of
Commerce" notes (which were monetised in
some cases by the Bank of France), Mexican
dollars&mdash;all came to its counter and were duly
honoured. But it turned up its nose at
American Confederate Bank notes and assignats
of the First French Republic (both useless except
for wall paper).</p>

<p>Various currency problems had to be solved by
"Pay." The Bank of France was always in a
state of worry over the huge consumption of 5
francs notes by the British Army. These were
the most favoured units for paying the men;
they seemed to disappear from currency at a
quick rate, and they were expensive to print.
The situation was improved by the adoption of
the suggestion of "Pay" that a 10-francs note
should be issued. Probably the Bank of France
would have been quite content if they had
thought that the 5 francs notes were destroyed.
But they knew that they were being hoarded up
by the French peasants, who absorbed every bit
of silver as soon as it was put into circulation,
and, after silver, favoured for their hoards notes
of small denominations. At the time of the
German advance in the Spring of 1918 "Pay"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
had a curious illustration of the hoarding ways
of these French peasants. That advance let
loose a flood of silver coinage. The people who
lived in districts which might have to be
evacuated changed their hoarded silver for
notes, which would be more handy to carry
away.</p>

<p>"Pay" at an early stage of the war put
forward an interesting proposal&mdash;the issue
of International Army Notes in various
denominations which would be good in any one
of the Allied Countries. The proposal was
never carried through, but its idea is being
revived in the financial world to-day by the
proposal for an International Bank to take over
some or all of the war debts of the Allies and
issue a paper currency good in any one of the
Allied Countries.</p>

<p>The encouragement of thrift among the
soldiers was part of the work of "Pay." In
August, 1915, it secured soldier subscriptions to
the War Loan to the extent of £25,200. The
next year it established Savings Banks, and in
1918 it set up agencies at all Army Post Offices
for the sale of War Savings Certificates. But
its greatest achievement in the way of thrift
was the Chinese Savings Bank, which was
started in August, 1918, and in a fortnight had
deposits of 400,000 francs.</p>

<p>The last welcome task of "Pay" was to
establish Field Cashiers in Germany and to fix<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
a rate of exchange for German money, which
was started at five marks=2s. 8d.</p>

<p>The Claims Commission (established in
December, 1914) was another branch of the
financial organisation. Its business was to
decide upon claims for damage done by the
British Army to the property of civilians,
French or Belgian. The British Army paid for
everything, even to an orchard tree that an
Army mule had nibbled at. Claims made were
sometimes ridiculous in character and in extent.
In my regimental experience I remember a
market gardener claiming 200 francs on account
of damage done by a horse which had wandered
into his potato patch for a few minutes. The
claim was very amicably settled on the spot by
the payment in cash of two francs. On an
average, "Claims" paid about one fourth of
the total asked for, and the civilian population
did very well indeed on that.</p>

<p>In the very early days of the war the civil
population of France, filled with relief and
gratitude at the arrival of the British Force,
of whose coming they had almost despaired,
greeted officer and soldier with the most
generous hospitality. Indeed as the "Old
Contemptibles" marched through Boulogne
women stripped off their rings to give them to
the marching soldiers. Wine, fruit, and other
delicacies were pressed on everybody without
payment. That generous enthusiasm could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
last through a four years' war, but to the very
end the best of the French population recognised
a duty of hospitality to their British guests.
It was only natural, however, that many of the
peasants and small traders, hard hit by the war,
should take advantage of their opportunities to
make profit out of our Army. This was
particularly noticeable after the coming of the
Colonial troops, who were just as lavish in
spirit as the British Tommies and had a good
deal more pay to spend.</p>

<span class="caption">MAJOR-GENERAL L. B. FRIEND<br />

</div>

<p>The Claims Commission, which in the later
stages of the war had its headquarters at Paris
Plage and Le Touquet, did its work to
the satisfaction of everybody. At first its
responsibilities were confined to paying claims
for damage done. Later it took over all the
financial adjustments in connection with the
hiring and the requisition of civilian land and
property. Its tasks called for a great deal of
tact and a wide variety of resourcefulness. In
the Spring of 1918 the abandonment in
evacuated areas by civilians of wine and
portable property caused trouble. The events
at Amiens illustrate the position. As soon as
the city came under enemy shell fire the civil
authorities left, and with them most of the
respectable inhabitants. Less respectable
people remained, and probably were guilty of
some excesses. The British Army Authorities,
however, were prompt in taking over control,
and on April 3rd the city was quiet and orderly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
But very serious reports of damage by
British troops were put into circulation. On
investigation by the Claims Department the
actual cases resolved themselves into two: in
one house three doors had been broken down; in
the other case the British Army had stolen a
rabbit "which had been abandoned by its
owners." These were the only two charges
definitely preferred. But it was, seemingly, a
fact that in some villages outside of Amiens
regrettable incidents arose from the fleeing
civilians abandoning stores of wine or disposing
of them to the troops at sacrifice prices. The
French Authorities were asked to assist in
forbidding the importation by civilians of
intoxicants into threatened areas.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the war some of the
French towns which had been sheltering large
numbers of British troops raised the question of
the payment of octroi duties on the goods
consumed by the troops. As I suppose is well
known, French towns have local customs duties
(called octroi because the right to collect them
for local purposes was originally a concession
from the King). All food, etc., coming into
the town pays a small tax. Supplies for the
British Army did not pay this tax, and the
towns complained of the loss thus caused to
their municipal revenues. G.H.Q. willingly
conceded the payment of octroi. A lump sum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
was allowed for the past period, and an
arrangement made for the future payment of so
much per head every half year for each soldier
billetted within the town boundaries. The
<i>per capita</i> charge varied greatly. A few
French towns refused to make any claim,
saying that they were well content to make that
concession to their British guests.</p>

<p>On the whole the financial record of the
British Army in France is something to be
proud of. We paid justly&mdash;sometimes
generously&mdash;for everything, and no civilian was
left with a legitimate grievance.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h4>THE ECONOMY SERVICES.</h4>

<h4>What the German submarines taught us&mdash;The
Salvage Organisation&mdash;O.C. Rags, Bones and Swill&mdash;Agriculture's
good work and hard luck&mdash;The
Forestry Directorate&mdash;Soldiers learn economy in a
stern school.</h4>


<p>There is a sort of grim pleasantry in the fact
that the German submarine war, which was to
bring Great Britain to her knees, only brought
her to a school of economy where she learned
some lessons which will be very useful in the
future, once the after-the-war phase of reckless
extravagance has passed away. When the
cumulative effect of the unlimited submarine
war made itself felt in 1918 it did not stop
operations, though it may claim some of the
responsibility for the extent of the German
success in the Spring of that year, which might
have been much more limited if we had had
full supplies of wire and other defence material.
What it did do was to set G.H.Q. to devising
valuable economies.</p>

<p>The German was in effect too late with this,
as with his other desperate steps. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
outset of the war, with an inferior sea power,
Germany had yet the chance of using sea forces
with great, and perhaps decisive, effect by raids
on the British supply routes with light cruisers
and converted merchantmen. She had prepared
for this but neglected the one necessary act of
forethought and daring by not sending out to
sea her commerce destroyers. Such a sea policy
would, of course, have been ruthless; but it could
have been made effective without violation of
sea law and without outrages on neutrals.
After August, 1914, Germany sought vainly
to repair her initial lack of sound naval sense
by the submarine naval war, in which every
canon of sea law and every sentiment of justice
and humanity were violated. The more the
submarine war showed signs of failing the more
atrocious and reckless it became, until in its
final shape it set almost all the world against the
German Empire. Yet withal the U-boat
atrocities went for nothing. The German
people must see now that their Prussian masters
put them very much in the position of the
innkeeper of the old creepy German story. He
and his wife resolved to kill in his sleep and
rob a chance traveller who had come to their
inn. They killed him and found that his purse
was empty and that he was their own long-lost
son.</p>

<p>On the debit side, as a result of the German
submarine war we had in 1918 a lack of certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
material&mdash;particularly of chocolate, biscuits,
and tinned fruits in the canteens. On the credit
side we had those fine economy organisations,
Salvage, Agriculture and Forestry, the effect of
which was not only to make savings at the time
but also to teach the soldier a fuller appreciation
of his civil duties.</p>

<p>"Salvage" explained itself very clearly in
its official publication:</p>

  <blockquote><p>"The world shortage of almost every

<p>"Salvage" had to suffer much from kindly
"ragging." It was known as "Rags and
Bones," and as "Swill." It was the favoured
sport of the humourist to devise new salvage
dodges, one of which I recall as holding the
record for sheer asininity. It drew attention
to the fact that the little circles of paper,
punched out of folios so that they could be put
on files, might be collected and sold as confetti!</p>

<p>But with all this "ragging," G.H.Q. had a
very real respect and liking for Brigadier-General
Gibbs and his Salvage Corps, and
recognised fully the solid and practical
patriotism which made them devote a passionate
interest to the recovery of solder from old tins,
to collecting waste paper, old boots, nails,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
horseshoes, rags and buttons. "There is
nothing of the débris of the battlefield which
we cannot put to some use," General Gibbs
announced; and by his personal enthusiasm he
made Salvage collection quite a popular sport
in the Army.</p>

<p>Some of the items of salvage value from a
return will show the wide range of the department:
swill for piggeries, value 16,000 francs;
solder from old tins, value 91,000 francs; cotton
waste, 14,000 francs; tin-plate (won by
unrolling old biscuit tins, etc.), 61,000 francs;
old lead, 10,000 francs; various bye-products
7,000,000 francs. The old rags collected did a
great deal to help the cloth shortage at Home,
as they made the best kind of shoddy. The
old bones collected helped to find the glycerine
for explosives.</p>

<p>But perhaps the moral effect of the Salvage
department was even more valuable than its
excellent material results. War is a wretchedly
wasteful business and must inculcate in soldiers
a spirit of waste. But in the final phase of this
campaign every soldier had brought home to
him most urgently the wisdom of saving and the
real value of what seemed to be waste bye-products.
Many of them must have learned
the lesson and carried it home with them to the
advantage of the general community.</p>

<p>Agriculture was another economy organisation
that we owed to the German submarine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
war. It had begun in a small way towards the
end of 1917; indeed its germ was alive before
then, for from the first our units had helped the
French with labour and horses during harvest
time, and some units enjoying a certain security
of tenure had established flower and vegetable
gardens. But in December, 1917, the world's
food position suggested an earnest effort to
utilise spare labour and spare land within army
areas in France to grow food. Major-General
Ellison and Dr. Keeble came over to G.H.Q.
from the War Office, and a scheme was drawn
up to cultivate 50,000 acres of land. In
January, 1918, an Agriculture Directorate was
formed under Brigadier-General the Earl of
Radnor, and search was made for a suitable
area for a big farm. The quest was not a
simple one. We could not poach on land that
the French might want. We wished to avoid
selecting an area which might be needed for a
man&oelig;uvre ground for our troops in the carrying
out of the next Big Push. In seeking to
avoid these two rocks we landed on a worse one.
The area selected around Roye-Nesle was the
area which the Germans were going to over-run
in their Spring offensive. All unconscious
of that, we began ploughing in February,
1918. The Home authorities had supplied an
abundance of excellent machinery, and labour
was quickly collected and trained. By March
21st we had got up to a record of ploughing 300
acres per day and a total of 4,742 acres had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
been turned over. Then the German came.</p>

<p><a name="i_0191"></a></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 439px;">
<img src="images/page_0191.jpg" width="439" height="600" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">BRIG-GENERAL THE EARL OF RADNOR<br />
(Director of Agricultural Production)</span>
</div>

<p>By a fine feat of organisation and courage
the Agriculture Directorate saved most of its
machinery. Some of the agricultural tractors
came in useful as aids to the heavy artillery in
the retreat. Others, charging for home at their
best speed, were mistaken for German Tanks
and in one or two cases fired on by our troops.</p>

<p>Despite that unlucky experience with the big
farm, Agriculture put to its credit some useful
work. It had promoted vegetable gardens in
Base Camps, and the total area of those gardens
was 7,496 acres and their products did much to
help out the rations. Soon, too, "Agriculture"
found that though it had not sown on its big
farm it might still reap in other quarters. The
German onrush had brought a great area of
French cultivated land within army areas,
some of it actually within the zone of fire. Since
every ear of wheat was precious, Agriculture
organised to save this part of the French
harvest, and actually reaped the product of
18,133 acres. It was gallant work, done mostly
by fighting men in the intervals between their
turns in the trenches. Sometimes the area to be
reaped was under the fire and the observation of
the enemy, and the crop was cut at night. The
enemy used gas shells to prevent this work, and
the reapers had to work in gas masks. One
area of six acres of corn was so close to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
enemy trenches that the idea of saving it seemed
a desperate one. But volunteers were found,
and one night seventeen men with scythes
cleared the whole six acres, in the three hours of
darkness that were available. I own that such
acts of heroism impress me more than deeds done
in the heat and ardour of battle.</p>

<p>In the Autumn of 1918 the enemy were in
full run for the Rhine, and the Agriculture
Directorate resolved to make another attempt
at cultivating a big farm. An area of 20,000
acres was chosen, this time near Corbie. The
site had been desolated by the Somme battles,
and the work of preliminary clearing (which
was done by Prisoners of War) was the hardest
part of its preparation for agriculture. But
when ploughing began with tractors other
unexpected difficulties cropped up. The big
armour-piercing shell with delay-action fuse,
when it missed the emplacement for which it
was designed and struck the ground, penetrated
to a great depth, exploded there, and often
formed a big subterranean cavern without
showing any crater on the surface. A heavy
tractor going over one of these caverns would
break through and disappear. Digging it out
would then be a laborious task.</p>

<p>When the Armistice came the Corbie farm
was, in accordance with the wishes of the
French Government, passed over to it. So
the Agriculture Directorate never got in a big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
crop of its own sowing. But it had done
excellent work on its farm gardens and in saving
the French crop within the battle area.</p>

<p>Forestry was another department which we
owed to the German submarine war. In 1916
shipping losses were already so great as gravely
to prejudice the prospects of bringing in timber
from Scandinavia. It was Scandinavia which
felt the earliest effects from the submarine
campaign; Norway, especially, which with fine
courage had refused to allow its mercantile
shipping to take refuge in harbour.</p>

<p>The Norwegian paper <i>Tidens Tegn</i> published
an optimistic statistical review of the
position as regards Germany's submarine war
on October 9th, 1917. This, covering a wide
period and dealing with a mercantile service
which the German pursued with particular
venom, attracted great attention at the time.
Pointing out that for the week ending October
9th not one Norwegian vessel was sunk by
German submarines, the <i>Tidens Tegn</i> commented
that this was the first time for a year
that such a thing could be said. It gave then in
detail the record of U-boats' ravages on
Norwegian shipping from May, 1917, until
October, 1917, the record showing a steady
decrease of losses. But the sad truth was that
the Norwegian shipping had suffered such
terrible losses that there was not much left of
it to destroy.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>As early as November, 1916, owing to the
difficulties in getting Scandinavian timber, we
had decided to draw our timber supplies chiefly
from the French forests and from Switzerland,
Spain, and Great Britain. Our Forestry
Department started with a Canadian lumber-men's
unit. Brig.-Gen. Lord Lovat was
Director. In October, 1917, a fresh agreement
was made with the French Government for the
exploitation of French forests for the benefit
of the Allied Armies. The magnitude of the
operations can be gauged from the fact that the
Forestry Directorate grew to 425 officers and
11,000 of other ranks, and employed in addition
about 6,000 prisoners of war. But perhaps the
public, with Whitehall departments in its
mind's eye, may object that employment figures
are no sound indication of work accomplished.
But the production figures admit of no cavil.
From November, 1917, to November, 1918, the
Forestry Department produced from French
forests 2,065,074 tons of timber. This was
four-fifths of the total needs of the Army.
Reference will be found in a subsequent chapter
to our shortage of barbed wire in the Winter
and Spring of 1918. Forestry did a great deal
to fill the gap, producing 90,000 tons of
defensive pickets between February and May,
1918.</p>

<span class="caption">AT FORESTRY H. Q., THE KING AND A MASCOT</span>
</div>

<p>In addition to its productive work Forestry
was a valuable Directorate in the teaching of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
economy in forest exploitation. If the lessons
it inculcated are not wasted, British forestry
should benefit greatly in the future.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Salvage, Agriculture, and Forestry were the
three chief "Economy Directorates" of
G.H.Q.; and if their spirit can be carried back
into civil life by the demobilised soldier it will
prove of real value in making up for the
economic wastage of the war, vast as that has
been. I wonder if those people who are
celebrating peace with a long-drawn-out
carnival of slackness and extravagance
recognise as clearly as we were made to do at
G.H.Q. in 1918 the extent to which the world
is short of everything! Of course it is difficult
for those who are not accustomed to give close
attention to the problems of production to
appreciate how deeply a world war of four
years' duration affects every industry; and
especially so when on one side the war was
waged on the principle of destroying everything
that could be got at, whether it was military or
civil property, whether it was an enemy or a
neutral possession. Germany, making a ruthless
and unlimited war on "sink without trace"
lines, forced practically the whole world to
band against her in self-defence; and over
practically the whole world labour and capital
were largely withdrawn from production for
purposes of defence.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>In the days when the builders of Jerusalem
worked with the trowel in one hand and the
sword in the other, it may be concluded that
progress was slow. For years a great deal of
the world had the rifle in one hand and the gas
mask in the other, figuratively or literally. It
could do little in the way of normal production,
because its chief energies were taken up with
defence.</p>

<p>In regard to any industry, trace step by step
the effect of a war such as this war. The first
and most palpable loss is that of the labour
directly withdrawn for armies and navies.
That would be serious enough if it were the sole
loss. But it was only one of many losses. A
modern industry depends as much almost on
capital as on labour. Capital was withdrawn
from production and devoted to destruction at
an appalling rate. That meant that industry
was starved of machinery, of communications,
of nutriment generally. Like a human body
deprived of proper nourishment, it began to
suffer from debility. Every neglect to replace
machinery, to repair roads or to open up
necessary new roads, every draft, too, made on
the administrative staff, is just as much a
weakening of an industry as the direct loss of
hand workers. A healthy industry should be
able to withstand for some time these losses,
just as a healthy human body should be able to
withstand some period of privation and even of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
actual starvation. But there is a limit to the
power of endurance in both cases. It is quite
clear that in many world industries (and most
particularly in those industries which are
connected with the great staples of human
comfort, the food industries, the clothing
industries, the transport industries) that limit
was reached long before the war was over, and
the world began to suffer from a constitutional
enfeeblement of its powers of production;
something more serious than the temporary
interruption of production, something which
makes now a restoration of prosperity difficult
and tedious.</p>

<p>All this is so true as to be truism. But it
does not seem to be so clearly recognised by the
people who stayed at home as by the people who
went to war. Perhaps as the returned soldier
makes his influence felt more strongly he will
have his value in bringing the nation to a sense
of the duty of economy. It was not possible to
have two views about the need of economy when
you had to forage the battlefield for old bits of
metal and rags.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h4>THE COMFORTS OF THE FORCE&mdash;SPIRITUAL AND
OTHER.</h4>

<h4>The Padres&mdash;The semi-religious organisations&mdash;E.F.C.
Comforts&mdash;Studying the Fighting man&mdash;The
Great Beer Save.</h4>


<p>"There has never been an army that had
more chaplains, or that needed them less."
That was the verdict of one American observer
on the British Army&mdash;a sound one. The
British Army was notably well supplied with
chaplains&mdash;"padres" as the soldier knows
them; but this was not in answer to a call for
spiritual leaders to combat a special degree of
wickedness. Quite the contrary. The Army
was a very well-behaved, sober-minded institution
on the whole, as if it recognised the
solemnity of its task and fitted its conduct
accordingly. To this fact the French population
can bear witness. The French villagers
among whom the British soldiers have been
quartered came to a view of them which was
once eloquently expressed: "They are lions in
the trenches and lambs in the villages."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>So the padre went out for duty with the
troops having no task of leading a forlorn hope
against ramping wickedness. His trouble was
rather in the other direction. "I don't see
how I can have the 'front' to preach to these
men," said a padre attached to an Artillery
Division one day: "I'd rather they preached
to me."</p>

<p>It really was a difficult task&mdash;that of the
padre at the Front, and only the best type of
clergyman made a success of it. His attitude
to life had to be manly, his character brave.
But the padre who ran risks just for the sake of
running them was often more of a bother than
a help. The best padre's spirit was that of
the careful soldier who will face any danger
that comes in the way of duty, but will not go
looking for danger in a spirit of bravado. The
padre could make two mistakes. He could take
things too easily and just be a parson available
to conduct Divine service when he was wanted
to; or he could try to do too much, to interfere
too much and become a nuisance in the fighting
line. The good padre struck the happy mean.
He had the knack of being there when he was
wanted, but he recognised that the Army's first
duty was to fight, and he did not get in the way
of its fighting activities. Above all he did not
try to arrange a church parade for the morning
after tired troops from the line had reached
rest billets.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the most successful padres in France
was known as "the Lost Sheep." He had a
Mess to which he was properly attached
and this Mess was responsible for having a
comfortable billet for him. But he was rarely
"At home." He wandered all over the
district, picking up a meal here and there and
sleeping wherever he found himself after
dinner. At first it was thought to be fecklessness
on his part. As a matter of fact it was
artfulness. Moving about as he did, taking a
meal and a bed anywhere, he got to know everybody
and found out who needed him as padre.</p>

<p>The actual organisation of the padre service
was a little difficult for the layman to understand.
The "Principal Chaplain" with the
Forces was a Presbyterian clergyman, the Rev.
J. M. Simms. Under him came all the padres,
including Roman Catholic priests, except the
padres of the Church of England, who had a
separate organisation under a Deputy Chaplain
General, Bishop Gwynne, who had been Bishop
of Khartoum before the war. What was the
exact reason for the division of authority I
could never quite make out. There was no ill-feeling
at all or jealousy between the various
padres. The Principal Chaplain had his headquarters
at Montreuil and was a regular visitor
to the Officers' Club. The Deputy Chaplain
General had his headquarters at Paris Plage.</p>

<p>Of the typical padre it was said that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
responsible for at least as many sports meetings
in rest camps as Divine services, but was a
genuinely spiritual man withal. There was
credited to one the aphorism that the men did so
much worshipful work in the trenches that in
rest camps the first thing to be rightly thought
of was relaxation.</p>

<p>G.H.Q. Staff I fear were poor Church-goers.
The Commander-in-Chief set a good example by
attending Divine Service almost every Sunday
at Montreuil, but most of the Staff Officers
followed the maxim "<i>laborare est orare</i>" and
were at their desks on Sunday. The padres
understood the position and there were no
reproaches.</p>

<p>At meals at the Officers' Club there were
always a few padres. We were not expected to
make too much concession to "the cloth" in
the way of conversation, and the average padre
stood his chaffing with the best of them.</p>

<p>I noted one, who had a rather pontifical
manner (though he was a thoroughly good
fellow at heart), take a hard hit in a sporting
fashion. The conversation had turned on Lord
Roberts' campaign before the war to try to
arouse the British people to a sense of the
imminence of the war and the necessity of
preparation. The padre blundered in with:</p>

<p>"It seems to me that Lord Roberts and his
friends must have been singularly lacking in
clearness of argument and persuasiveness seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
that, knowing the truth as they did yet they
were not able to convince the people."</p>

<p>"Yes," retorted an officer, "arguing on the
same lines, quite a number of excellent gentlemen
seem to have been singularly lacking in
clearness of argument and persuasiveness for
nearly 2,000 years, seeing that, knowing the
greatest truth of all, they have not yet been able
to convince the world."</p>

<p>The padre took it in the right spirit and
owned that it is not necessarily a reflection on
a preacher if his hearers will not listen. Lord
Roberts' name was venerated by most officers,
and the Army was glad that when the time
came for the good old man to lay down his sword
it was from among old comrades at G.H.Q. that
he passed away.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In addition to the padre service the British
soldier in the field had a great number of semi-spiritual
organisations looking after him.
These followed a sound rule, generally, of
providing hot coffee and harmless recreation as
the best missionary work. G.H.Q. recognised
the Y.M.C.A., the Church Army and the
Salvation Army as semi-religious agencies, and
all these bodies did excellent work in providing
rest huts and reading and recreation rooms for
the troops, and thus keeping them out of
mischief when they had idle times. Satan,
when he came roaming round, found the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Army well dug in, and plenty of wire out.</p>

<p>To some proposed forms of guarding the
welfare of the soldier G.H.Q. had to refuse
sanction. There were many cranks with very
curious notions on this point. Perhaps the
most remarkable proposal was that which came
from a lady, the goodness of whose intentions
was obvious but who had "a marked moral
strabismus," as a Scots doctor pawkily
observed. She wanted to form an organisation
of ladies (and said she could do so) to meet
soldiers at the ports of disembarkation and
take them to homes where would be provided all
the comforts of domesticity. I believe that
some such organisation once actually existed in
an Eastern country whilst it was at war. But
so far as the B.E.F. was concerned it had to be
discouraged.</p>

<p>The last line of entrenchments against ennui
and discomfort was provided by that wonderful
organisation the Expeditionary Force Canteens.
It provided for officers and men cheap shops,
good rest and recreation centres, and for officers
excellent hotels. The officer thus had never
to wander to strange places. From the
Expeditionary Force Canteens during the
greater part of the time you could buy cigars,
cigarettes, chocolate, sweets, all kinds of canned
goods and so on, duty free, and at prices far
lower than those of the London shops. Whisky
and beer could be bought, too, duty free, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
some restrictions. The E.F.C. was, in short,
the great comfort-bringer to the soldier at the
front. I say comfort-bringer, for all necessities
were supplied by rations.</p>

<p>Just consider what Tommy got from the
country he was serving: an ample supply of
meat (fresh meat in the main), and bacon and
cheese, of bread, and of biscuit; a fair supply
of vegetables, of butter, of jam, of tea, milk
and sugar; a moderate supply of tobacco and
cigarettes; a small ration of rum. I know from
my own experience that one could live
excellently on the men's rations. Nothing was
actually needed to supplement them. But
comforts, well, they were comforting; and the
E.F.C. by bringing them almost up to the front
trenches (as they did) helped materially to win
the war.</p>

<p>The Expeditionary Force Canteens organisation
was formed early in 1915 for the supply of
canteen facilities to the troops in the field. Its
operations commenced in France, but were
subsequently extended to all theatres of war.
The undertaking was from its commencement
conducted by Sir Alexander W. Prince
and Colonel F. Benson, both of whom
patriotically gave their services. In due
course the organisation took on various other
functions, but its canteen business alone made
it by far the biggest shopping concern in the
world. The "supplies and shipping" department<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
of the E.F.C. had for canteens alone an
average annual turnover of approximately
500,000,000 francs. From three to four
thousand lines appeared on the stock sheets,
ranging from a packet of pins to officers' equipment.</p>

<p>The tonnage handled was enormous, and
during the month of November, 1918, it reached
nearly twelve thousand tons, representing
320,000 cases. But the record week was that
ending March 16th, 1918, just prior to the great
German offensive, when 3,643 tons of canteen
supplies were landed, and a turnover amounting
to 10,586,407 francs was reached. The tonnage
off-loaded for the year 1918 was 121,000 tons,
and comprised over three million packages.</p>

<p>Here is a table of figures of total sales at
canteens and depôts:&mdash;</p>

<p>The E.F.C. was in business for the good of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the troops, not to make profits for anyone. All
profits that were earned will go back to the
soldiers. But profits were kept to a strict
minimum. By a happy decision prices for the
same goods were the same on every Front. You
bought a tin of tobacco at Baghdad for the
same price as at Boulogne. Thus the soldier on
the more comfortable nearer-home Fronts was
able to feel that the little percentage of profit
charged to him was helping his mate in
Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>Yet another fine feature of the E.F.C. work
was that it served the man in the front line first
and the man at the Base second. In 1917-1918
the shipping position was so bad that economies
had to be effected in every possible direction.
E.F.C. supplies had to suffer with the rest, and
the complaint came that what supplies did come
over were largely absorbed at Base and on Lines
of Communication, and the men in the front
line got very little. The Q.M.G. got rid of
that complaint very simply. An order went
out that: (1) certain luxuries which were in
very short supply should go only to front area
canteens and not at all to the Base; (2) other
goods should go in the proportion of four to
front areas and one to the Base. As a
consequence our Montreuil canteens were very
poorly stocked, for G.H.Q. of course did not
count as a front area. But the simple justice
of the step was recognised.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1918, the Home Government was forced to
the conclusion that the shipping position was
so bad that no more beer could be consigned to
the troops. Beer was a very bulky article and
its shipping space must be saved. G.H.Q. did
not like the prospect of stopping the soldiers'
beer just at a time when they had plenty of other
troubles. Perhaps G.H.Q. remembered a much
earlier B.E.F. in Flanders in the reign of Henry
VIII., which did very badly until that great
War Minister, Cardinal Wolsey, took the matter
of supplies in hand and saw that the Army was
well supplied not only with arrows but with
beef and beer. Thereafter that early B.E.F.
retrieved its reputation. It occurred to
G.H.Q., B.E.F., 1918, that whilst beer is a
very bulky article, most of the bulk is water.
Accordingly the Q.M.G. took over, in part or in
whole, breweries in our Army areas and
arranged to brew beer locally, importing only
from England the malt and the hops, which
were not particularly bulky.</p>

<p>I do not know whether the decision of the
Home Government was in part a concession to
teetotalism and in part only governed by
shipping considerations. If so the teetotallers
were disappointed. The British Army in 1918
continued to number beer among its comforts.</p>

<p>On the whole ours was the most comforted
and comfortable Army in the Field, as all
<i>liaison</i> officers from allied units agreed. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Americans were as well off in most respects,
but being a "dry" Army interfered somewhat
with the comfort of its majority. The average
American was not a teetotaller and did not
object to wine and beer or even an occasional
whisky. At his own canteens he had to be.
The French of course always had a wine ration,
but in other respects their "comforts" were
not up to our standard. The privilege that was
extended to French <i>liaison</i> officers of dealing at
our canteens was very highly appreciated.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h4>THE LABOUR AUXILIARIES.</h4>

<h4>The queer ways of the Chinks&mdash;How to bury a
Chinaman properly&mdash;The Q.M.A.A.C.s and their
fine record&mdash;Other types of Labour auxiliaries&mdash;The
Labour Directorate.</h4>


<p>The Great War revived, to a degree that few
dream of, methods of very old campaigns, when
the hero had his attendant myrmidons and the
Spartan foot soldier his helots. Study a
"ration strength" return of the B.E.F.,
France, 1918, and discover how the actual
fighting men in trench or gun-pit had to be
supported not only by Base soldiers but by
British non-combatant labour companies,
by French civilian labour companies, by
Q.M.A.A.C.s, by prisoner-of-war labour companies,
by Indian, West Indian, Fijian, and
Chinese labour companies. It was a big
business, this organisation of the labour behind
the fighting area.</p>

<p>Chinese labour was of very notable help to
the British Army. At its best it was the most
efficient and hard-working force imaginable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
At its worst it was at least a good source of fun.
The Chinaman came over to the war with very
definite ideas of making as good a thing out of
it as possible. "I sell my labour" was his
formula in signing the contract, and, though he
probably would not recognise as his own the old
British law formula <i>caveat emptor</i>, that was the
principle on which he acted. If the buyer of
his labour was fool enough to pay the price and
not get the work that was the buyer's look-out.</p>

<p>Every Chinese coolie on arrival (as we soon
found out) was "put wise" by the representative
of his secret society, his "Tong," that
"this is a good place. You have only to
pretend to work." He acted on that, and
unless the people in charge knew how to deal
with Chinese, so little was done as to make the
most finished British exponent of "ca-canny"
go green with envy. But, given an officer who
knew his business, knew how to get the Chinese
headmen to get the Chinese coolies to work, and
the results were splendid.</p>

<p>The Chinaman knew that by his contract he
was not to suffer war risks, that he was not
supposed to work under shell-fire, and he was
soon sufficiently advanced to interpret an
occasional air bombardment as "shell-fire,"
and to give it as a reason for demanding more
pay. As a rule he was willing to take risks,
if he were paid extra. When sick or wounded he
was a great nuisance, for if a Chinaman died of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
sickness whilst in charge of the white man the
conclusion was that he had been done to death.
Ordinarily a sick Chinaman demobilised two
workers&mdash;himself and some member of his own
secret society who had to accompany him to
hospital to see that all was fair.</p>

<p>The most earnest effort was therefore made
to keep the Chinaman from dying, not only from
ordinary motives of humanity, but because as a
corpse he was an even greater nuisance. A
British soldier might be buried in a blanket,
but the Chinese dead had to have wooden coffins,
and their graveyards had to be chosen with
great care&mdash;preferably in a valley with a stream
running through it. All this to satisfy the
spiritual world of the Chinese, which seems to
be very exigent in such matters. The official
instructions regarding Chinese graves stated:
"The ideal site to secure repose and drive away
evil spirits is on sloping ground with a stream
below, or gully down which water always or
occasionally passes. The grave should not be
parallel to the N.S.E. or W. This is specially
important to Chinese Mohammedans. It should
be about four feet deep, with the head towards
the hill and the feet towards the water. A
mound of earth about two feet high is piled over
the grave."</p>

<p>In matters of finance the Chinaman was also
a little bothersome. He had to have his pay
right down on the nail; he distrusted any white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
man's savings-bank or any system of deferred
pay. In time Chinese savings-banks were
instituted, and these solved the difficulty that
the Chinaman would not let the white paymaster
keep his money for him, and if he had it
in personal custody gambled it away.</p>

<p>Keener even than his passion for gambling
was the Chinaman's passion for decoration.
Was it in a sense of real fun on his part or
was it an accident that his taste for decoration
culminated in the two "grand passions"&mdash;an
Australian hat and a Scotsman's kilt? If
either of these came within his reach the
Chinaman knew real bliss. One Chinaman
who managed to get hold of both at once, and
paraded a Base town in their joint glory for a
full half-hour was the legendary hero of all the
Chinese coolies in France. Of course to be in
possession of an unauthorised article of military
equipment was an offence, and the Chinaman
going out in a kilt or an Australian hat, or
a general's red-haloed cap, knew that he was in
for severe punishment. That was no deterrent
if his ingenuity could secure, by theft or
purchase, such glory. As often as it did the
Chinaman was quite willing to stand the
subsequent racket. One Chinese coolie used to
light up a quarter of Boulogne with a decoration
that challenged military discipline successfully.
He had secured one of those brass basins still
used in places as barbers' signs, had fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
this on his ordinary coolie hat, polished it
resplendently, and sported it with Celestial
pride. His was the brassiest hat of any brass
hat in France; but the basin was not an article
of military equipment, and authority decided to
wink at it. In a hot sun you had to wink with
both eyes.</p>

<p>Discipline was good with the Chinese coolies
if the controlling officers knew their business
and took care to "save face" of the headmen of
the gangs. An officer had to see that the
headman did not fool him or ill-treat the coolies
and then to back up the headman always. If
the coolies got to think that the headman was
out of favour with the white boss nothing could
be done with them. In matters of prohibitions
the Chinese language showed a strange
inadequacy. It was decided to forbid smoking
in labour camps, and a notice "Smoking is
Prohibited," was printed in English, German,
and Chinese, to be affixed in the compounds.
After some months a distinguished visitor,
who was (or thought he was) skilled in the
Chinese language, pointed out to high authority
that the literal translation of the Chinese notice
was "Do not get caught smoking." The
educated Chinese who had drawn up the notice
originally was sent for. He blandly insisted
that that was the only way to say "Smoking
is Prohibited," in Chinese, and that the Chinese
coolie would understand nothing else.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>On the whole the Chinaman was a cheerful
soul. He organised his own theatrical companies
and enjoyed those interminable Chinese
operas which are familiar to travellers in the
East and to visitors to the Chinese quarters of
American or Australian cities.</p>

<p>The "Chink" gambled as much as the
regulations allowed him to. But he could
stand up to a hard day's work with constant
cheerfulness, and, apart from his craze for some
prohibited military decoration, contrived to
make his uniform picturesque enough. The
barber was an important unit of every camp,
for Chinese head-dressing is a matter of
complicated ritual.</p>

<p>Taking one consideration with another,
Chinese labour in France was a success. It
released many scores of thousands of men for
the fighting line. If the Germans had not
thrown in their hand at the time they did, it is
probable that another 100,000 coolies would
have been recruited in China for France, though
most other types of coloured labour were being
dispensed with as not being worth while.</p>

<p>Chinese labour has a way of cropping up in
British history. It might have lost the Mother
Country a whole continent of colonies at one
time, when Sir Henry Parkes, a leonine Norfolk
peasant who had become Prime Minister for
New South Wales, dared Great Britain to veto
Australian exclusion of Chinese immigrants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Later it loomed, with vast possibilities of
mischief, over South African history. In the
Great War Chinese labour appeared again, but
this time with no sinister threat of trouble, but
very helpful in matters of railway-building and
ship-building, and lightening, with a touch of
Celestial humour, the grim business of putting
the German in his place.</p>

<p>The Labour Directorate had control not
only of Chinese Labour but of all other
non-combatant working units, except the
W.A.A.C.s (or Q.M.A.A.C.s as they came to
be called when, as a reply to base gossip about
their morals, Queen Mary took nominal
command of the corps and they became Queen
Mary's Army Auxiliary Corps). Distinctly
cruel&mdash;though it was probably not meant to be
cruel and was only thoughtlessness&mdash;was the
gossip about the W.A.A.C.s. According to
some London scandal-mongers a very large
proportion of the Corps qualified for a
maternity hospital almost as soon as they got to
France. As a matter of fact the standard of
conduct among them was very high. They represented
at least the average of British womanhood,
probably they were ahead of the average,
and it would be a libel on our race to discredit
them with a charge of looseness.</p>

<p>Nor was it a fact that the W.A.A.C.s were
in a position unusually open to temptation; it
was quite the contrary. They were busy. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
soldiers among whom they worked were busy,
and it wasn't a case of the Devil having idle
hands at his mercy. Further, the system of
supervision was well thought out and excellently
administered. The W.A.A.C.s had better
guardianship than in the average British home.
They lived in settlements, with their own
recreation rooms. These settlements were
strictly out of bounds for soldiers. All private
houses, cafés, restaurants, etc., were "out of
bounds" to the W.A.A.C.s. Nor could a
W.A.A.C. "walk out" with a soldier in her
leisure time except by permission of her officer.</p>

<p>At G.H.Q. there were very few W.A.A.C.
clerks or telephone orderlies; but there was a
little band of W.A.A.C. waitresses at the
Officers' Club. A better set of girls it would
be hard to find, and it is hardly necessary to say
that they were always treated with respect and
courtesy by the officers. A saying at G.H.Q.
was that if you wanted to be sent away suddenly
there were two short courses to that undesirable
end: one, to curse your general to his face in
public, the other to be caught winking at a
W.A.A.C. G.H.Q. did not wink at the
W.A.A.C.s. We had too much respect for
them, too much gratitude for the spirit of
sportsmanship and patriotism that led them to
come out to France to lead a dull and laborious
life for our comfort. It is difficult to imagine
what a touch of "England, Home and Beauty"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
those deft young women gave after experience
of soldier orderlies as waiters.</p>

<p>From personal knowledge I can only speak
of the W.A.A.C.s at G.H.Q. But I had the
best of means of judging their general standard
of conduct throughout France. In case of a
lapse from grace a W.A.A.C. was retired from
the Corps, her uniform was withdrawn and she
had a grant of £5 to enable her to buy a civilian
costume. There were not many cases of that
£5 being paid.</p>

<p>But the W.A.A.C.s, as I have said, did not
come under the Labour Directorate but under
their own Administrator. Every one else whose
job was to work rather than to fight did,
and that made "Labour" an extraordinarily
interesting department. It had under its
control:</p>


<div class="centerlist">
<ul>
<li>(<i>a</i>) The Labour Corps, including:</li>
<li><ul>
<li>(<i>i</i>) Labour Companies.</li>
<li>(<i>ii</i>) Divisional Employment Companies.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) Canadian Labour Battalions.</li>

<li>(<i>k</i>) Prisoner of War Companies.</li>
<li>(<i>l</i>) French and Belgian Civilian Labour.</li>
</ul></div>

<p>The core of the organisation was British loyal
labour, men who were too old or too decrepit to
fight but who "did their bit" behind the lines,
making roads or working at various Army jobs.
These were excellent stout fellows, and as they
did not object to taking the risk of death for
their country, they could be, and were,
employed in areas of danger. Another type of
British Labour, not so admirable, were the
Conscientious Objectors. A few groups of
these were employed in France as burial parties,
etc. Yet another type was known as the
Middlesex Contingent&mdash;why that county should
have been associated with them I know not.
They were men British-born but of German
parentage, whose loyalty was suspect. They
could not be trusted in the army; they were used
for some types of labour, but were not allowed
near ammunition dumps or other points where
they might do mischief.</p>

<p>Second in order of merit came French and
Belgian civilian labour, men too old or decrepit
for the fighting line, but willing to work for a
wage. It was a condition of their employment
that they should not be stationed within range
of long-distance shell fire, but this condition
was sometimes relaxed at their own wish and
with the consent of the French Government.
At first the British Army insured these French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
workers against accident, illness, and death
through the French State Insurance Department.
Subsequently it was found more
economical to insure them directly.</p>

<p>German prisoners of war labour was under
the Labour Directorate, and in the organisation
of it some very good work was done. Prisoners
were very plentiful from 1916 onwards, and
the Labour Directorate, when a new push was
mooted, made its plans to have skeleton
prisoners-of-war companies ready to be filled by
the new prisoners as they arrived. I think the
record was in one case when three days after
some Germans arrived at our "cages," they
were at work on the roads at the rear of the
Army. It was the law that prisoners of war
should not be employed anywhere near the firing
line, and on the British side this law was very
strictly observed.</p>

<p>My impression of the Germans as road
labourers was not very favourable. They seemed
to loaf as much as they could. But some of the
German prisoners of the artisan class did
excellent work in our various shops and factories
at Base. In tailoring shops, motor repair
shops, etc., there were many German prisoners
who seemed to take a delight in intelligent
industry. German prisoners were very well
treated and got on very well with their guards.</p>

<p>Now to the various classes of coloured labour.
The Chinese I have already dealt with. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
were quite the most satisfactory on the whole.
The Indian labour was willing enough but did
not stand the climate so well. Kaffir labour
proved on the whole unsatisfactory, and so did
Egyptian labour. A West Indian contingent
did fairly good work. A model lot were the
Fijians, all volunteers (and all Christians, by
the way), and wonderfully good stevedores.
Unfortunately there were very few of them and
they did not stand the climate well. One of the
Fijian Labour Corps left his studies at Oxford
University to join up.</p>

<p>The Labour organisation had two main
objects:</p>

<blockquote><p>  (a) To release the fighting soldier for his
  legitimate work.</p>

<p>  (b) To assist the Services and Departments
  to carry out their tasks.</p></blockquote>

<p>Nine hours was the normal working day,
exclusive of the time occupied for meals and for
going to and from the place of work. If the
distance from the place of parade to the work
was more than 1½ miles, the time taken to march
the excess distance was deducted from the hours
of work. For labour of low medical category
the normal working day was eight hours.</p>

<p>Excellent work was done by the Labour
Corps. Its <i>morale</i> was carefully studied and it
was part of the instructions to officers that:</p>

  <blockquote><p>All ranks should have briefly explained to them
  the object of the work, for what, and by whom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
  it will be used, what purpose it will serve, and,
  especially, that all the work is being done for
  the prosecution of the war and is not merely a
  "fatigue." A few minutes spent in rousing the
  men's interest in their work is usually time well
  spent. A healthy spirit of emulation should be
  created by pointing out the quantity of work of
  any kind which should be done per day, and the
  amount done by other and better Companies.
  Above all the men must be made to understand
  that whether they are working on time, or on
  task work, no slacking can be allowed. The
  men in the fighting line depend on the men of the
  Labour Corps to keep them supplied with all they
  require.</p>

  <p>Our Allies are just as anxious for victory as we
  are. The French and the Belgians have suffered
  more than we have, but, in spite of it, never
  complain. Hence they should receive every
  consideration at our hands. As we are in their
  countries we should respect their customs and
  wishes as much as we can. In all our relations
  with any of our Allies, it is obviously desirable
  for us to be polite and courteous in our dealings
  with them. It must be borne in mind that every
  misunderstanding or unpleasantness tends to
  weaken our alliance and to help the enemy.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Labour Directorate, with many different
races to manage, their religions and food habits
to study, had one of the difficult tasks of the
war; and carried it out on the whole very well.
The chiefs of the directorate in my time at
G.H.Q. were Colonel (now General) E. G.
Wace, Lieut.-Col. S. G. L. Bradley, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Lieut.-Col. H. A. H. Newington, with Colonel
Fairfax as Adviser, Chinese Labour, and
Colonel Pritchard as Adviser, South African
Labour. The staff was about equally divided
between big business men and typical Oxford
men. It was always a pleasure at dinner to sit
at the same table with the "Labour" people.
They hunted, or rather dined, in couples as a
rule, a leading light of the commercial world
pairing off with one of the "Oxford group."
So one could always reckon on good talk and
argument from opposite points of view.</p>

<p>At the summit of its strength the Labour
Corps mustered 387,000, a great Army in itself,
and it had representatives of almost every
European nationality, Chinese, West Indians,
Pacific Islanders, Kaffirs, Zulus, Burmese,
Egyptians, Maltese and almost every Indian
race including Nagas, Pathans, Chins,
Manipuris, Bengalis and Santals. And the
Labour Corps' patriotism cost it dear at times;
for sometimes it had over a thousand casualties
in a month.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h4>G.H.Q. AND THE "NEW ARMY."</h4>

<h4>What G.H.Q. thought of the "Temporaries"&mdash;Old
prejudices and their reason&mdash;The material of
the "New Armies"&mdash;Some "New Army"
Officers who did not play the game&mdash;The Regular
Army Trade Union accepts its "dilutees."</h4>


<p>What did G.H.Q., whose view may be taken
as the authoritative one, think in 1918 of what
used to be known as "the New Army?"
G.H.Q. in 1918 represented in the main the
pick of the old Regular Army. Nearly all its
senior officers were "Regulars." The majority
of the junior officers were "Temporaries."
What was the feeling between them after the
mutual knowledge that the years had brought?</p>

<p>Often I talked this over at dinner, sometimes
with men whose opinions I had known in 1914
and 1915. There was H&mdash;&mdash;, for instance,
who, in those early years of the war, was an
unsparing critic of the "New Army" which
was, he used to say then, slovenly and a
makeshift sort of show and could not salute
properly, and suffered, and always would suffer,
from the "non-military mind."</p>

<p>The non-military mind, according to him,
was an affliction which was born in one, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
original sin, and could only be exorcised by
going to a Military Academy and becoming a
Regular Soldier. I used to be very meek and
long-suffering with him (he was senior to me)
and only occasionally mentioned people like
Blake (a civilian whom Cromwell made a
General, and afterwards an Admiral, and a
right good General and a right better Admiral
he was) or non-militarily-minded men like
Botha and Smuts.</p>

<p>But to what argument I did venture upon he
was impervious. I noted that fact for him and
quoted it as, perhaps, a characteristic of the
mind which was <i>not</i> non-military. And
altogether we had some charming quarrels, as
amusing, almost, as those of old men in their
clubs, who if they could not bicker could not
digest their dinners, and then where would they
be?</p>

<p>Now H&mdash;&mdash; takes it all back. He is at last
convinced that the New Army is all right. Of
course it is. Why should it not be? Is not
the British Empire all right? And is not the
New Army a sort of Representative Assembly
of the British Empire?</p>

<p>G.H.Q. in 1918 saw clearly enough that never
before in the history of any Empire was such
splendid raw material for an Army gathered
together as in Great Britain in 1914-1918.
There were things to offend dainty tastes in the
recruiting campaign of which the New Armies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
were the harvest. But nothing can spoil the
value of the result, that many hundreds of
thousands of the best men who ever served in
an Army joined the colours.</p>

<p>Judge the New Army by the standard of the
"Regulars."</p>

<p>The soldiers of the first Expeditionary Force
(the "Regulars," the men who, despite the
booming of certain special units, did the
greater part of the heroic work of Lord French's
command up to Loos) have proved themselves so
nobly that it is possible to say now, without
fear of offence, that if they had been judged as
individuals before they joined the Army, they
might not have been held to represent the best
average of the British people. There is nothing
ungracious in saying this now, when even the
furious and blinded foe is compelled to admit
their excellent virtue. The men of the old
Regular Army themselves would admit almost
unanimously that it was the Army that made
them, and that they occasionally took the
King's shilling for lack of prospect of another
shilling. The people of England must confess,
on their part, that they rather boasted of "not
being a military nation" and were content with
an army system which did not seek to levy fairly
upon the average manhood of the nation but
trusted chiefly to the patriotism and instinct for
rule of an officer class.</p>

<p>The material of the ranks was not bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
material, nor even poor material. The British
blood is a good brew. For it has tapped the
most adventurous and hardiest veins of the Celt,
the Anglo-Saxon, the Scandinavian, and the
Norman; and this British blood learned by some
subtle alchemy to draw always fresh savour and
wholesomeness from the girdling sea. Put out
of consideration a few criminal degenerates,
and the mentally emasculated politicians who
used to preach the gospel of no nationalism, and
no British stock is actually bad stock, as can be
seen from the superb young nations that have
sprung, partly from its lees, in the Dominions.</p>

<p>But the raw material of the New Armies
represented a great improvement on the raw
material from which was built up the old
army. Other things being equal, therefore,
the New Armies could be expected to beat
the Expeditionary Force. Other things,
unfortunately, were not equal, such as officers'
education and time of training. But in all the
circumstances the New Armies, after some
blooding, might be expected to attain, and
actually did attain, the high standard set in the
field by the British Regular.</p>

<p>The material of the New Armies was such as
no recruiting sergeant in 1913 could have hoped
to secure. In a fairly typical batch of recruits
which I had to take over one day were engine-fitters,
brass finishers, coal miners, agricultural
labourers, gamekeepers, two foremen, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
compositor, one valet, one pugilist (a champion),
one stud groom, one cycle mechanic, one clerk.
The wages of these men before they joined was
high, and only two out of thirty-eight had been
of the "usually unemployed" class. Among
these men, accustomed to the discipline of the
workshop, many of them with experience as
gangers or foremen, possible non-commissioned
officers were sprinkled thickly. I have seen
batches of recruits for the old army just when
they joined, and they looked usually rather
forlorn&mdash;men accustomed to be unemployed,
men at a loose end, disappointed men, with just
a sprinkling of eager men taking to the soldier's
life for the love of it. Only after three months
of the wholesome life, the wholesome food, the
kindly discipline of the Army, would they
fairly compare in physique, manhood, and
intelligence with the recruits of the New
Armies.</p>

<p>A well-marked stream coming to join the
flood of New Army recruits was that of British
men from overseas. The British blood is
strangely responsive to the magic of the seas.
Send a careless young Englishman abroad to
Australia, South Africa, or to some foreign
land such as China or the Argentine, and the
salt air of the seas as he traverses them seems to
set tingling in his blood a new keenness of
Imperial pride. His outlook comes closer to
that of the Elizabethan Englishman. Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
it is from the first actual consciousness of what
it means to be one of a nation which is mistress
of the seas. Perhaps one must seek deeper for
a more transcendental explanation, finding it in
something analogous to the Greek myth of the
giant who renewed his strength whenever he
touched Mother Earth.</p>

<p>Let the reason be what it may, the fact is clear
enough. Of British men abroad&mdash;I speak now
of British born, not of those born citizens of
the Dominions&mdash;one can dare the guess that
ninety-nine out of a hundred turned their
thoughts at once to the joy of service on the
outbreak of this war.</p>

<p>In a city of China I know there were 18 young
Englishmen in various commercial houses. Of
them 17 came away home to the war. In most
cases it meant abandoning their positions and
all their future prospects. Money was scarce,
and the little band travelled steerage. To
realise how great a sacrifice that was, one must
know the tropics and the disgusts of having
coolies for fellow-travellers. From the
Argentine, from Canada and the United States,
from New Zealand and Australia, the English
streamed home to serve. From such a place as
the Argentine there was almost a stampede of
British men of fighting age.</p>

<p>Starting with a big handicap of quality in
their favour, the men of the New Armies very
soon found that it was all necessary if, within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the much briefer time allowed them to become
fit for the fighting line, they were to succeed in
keeping level with the soldiers who would be
their comrades. The recruits of the old Regular
Army before the war came into an organisation
which was officered, from brigade generals down
to junior subalterns, by specialists. Officers
were drawn mostly from a class with a tradition
of rule, and were given a very close training.
Those who came in as officers from circles which
had not that tradition were in a minority, and
during their course of training learned to
conform to the pattern set. Very much of the
success of the British Army has been due to the
qualities of courage, coolness, and <i>noblesse
oblige</i> of the officers. As a class they gave the
best of leads&mdash;a far better lead than did the
generally domineering, sometimes brutal,
German officers. The recruits to the New
Armies did not have the advantage of coming
to an organisation fully officered by men with
this tradition of command and technical
knowledge of their work. They had to rely for
officers on material which was slightly poorer
on the average.</p>

<p>The officers of the New Armies came from five
sources:&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote><p>1. A few officers spared from units at the
  Front and devoting themselves to the dull
  but glorious duty of helping on the new
  men. These were usually first class.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

  <p>2. "Dug-outs." A "dug-out" is not a
  form of entrenchment or shelter but an
  officer who, having completed, as he
  thought, his soldier's work, volunteered
  back to service in the New Army. Some
  of the dug-outs were up to the standard of
  the Regular Army and, having kept abreast
  of modern military progress, were able to
  "take post" from the outset. Other
  dug-outs were more or less behind-hand
  with modern military science. A few were
  frankly deplorable. But the "dug-out"
  in the majority of cases made an excellent
  officer after a little schooling (sometimes
  without). Lots of him were at G.H.Q.
  Sometimes he proved valuable only for the
  preliminary work of regimental organisation,
  and was then remorselessly passed
  over when his unit was finally put into
  shape for the Front. He bombarded the
  War Office with furious protests, then
  took up the licking into shape of another
  raw unit.</p>

  <p>3. Promoted non-commissioned officers from
  the Regular Force, nearly always proficient
  in their technical work, and in the majority
  of cases with also a sound instinct of
  leadership.</p>

  <p>4. Recruited officers from the Universities and
  the public schools. Almost invariably they
  had a sense of leadership. They had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
  learned a tradition of rule. In most cases
  they soon learned the technical part of their
  work.</p>

  <p>5. Recruited officers from the bulk of the
  community: in many cases very good;
  sometimes just passing muster; in a few
  cases distinctly poor. The necessity of a
  weeding-out was soon recognised.</p></blockquote>

<p>Summing up in regard to the officers of the
New Armies it has to be admitted that they
came below the standard of the Expeditionary
Force, but not much below the standard: and
that they got to the standard of the Territorials.</p>

<p>Put to the test of getting a post at G.H.Q.,
which was supposed to be the crowning test of
efficiency, the New Army Officers did not do
badly. I made a rough poll one night at the
club dinner. More than half the officers present
were "New Army" men. In what may be
called "specialist" branches New Army men
predominated.</p>

<p>The very wide sweep of the net which
gathered in recruits gave the New Armies a very
varied stock of knowledgeable men to draw
upon. The ideal army officer should be, besides
a gentleman and a skilled tactician, a good
horse-master, a good house-keeper, and a clever
mechanician, able to train men, to repair a
telephone, a saddle, a cooking-pot or a wagon.
No one man can have all that knowledge in
perfection, but with the New Armies it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
possible to get within a unit men trained in civil
life to every form of skill wanted. A regiment,
with average luck, would have recruits from the
most varied industries and trades, and the
picked specialists in time got to "staff jobs"
as a rule.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The "Regular" in 1914 and early 1915 was,
I suppose, pretty generally convinced that there
was not much hope in the "Temporary."
Especially was this conviction firm in the mind
of the very junior Regular. The "Shop"
boy, the young second lieutenant just from
Woolwich, had a blighting scorn for the
"Temporary," whom he called a "Kitchener"
and often affected to regard as not an officer at
all but some sort of stranger whom you had to
admit to Mess and tolerate in uniform because
authority said so, but who obviously was not a
"pukka" military man, for he could not talk
about his "year" or exchange stories about
wonderful "rags." The average senior
Regular probably thought very much the same
sort of thing, but, having cut his wisdom teeth,
did not allow it to show so palpably.</p>

<p>There was a certain amount of justification
for this feeling, for the advent of the huge
number of "New" officers made a vast change
in the social conditions of the Army. It soon
became obviously necessary that the Temporary
"Pip-Squeak" should come under a severely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
motherly eye&mdash;that of the War Office and of
various private philanthropic agencies who
would have us all dull and good (and if we
cannot be both we can be the one at least). That
eye then also glared upon the Temporary
lieutenant and other Temporary officers of more
exalted grade, and also, to their intense disgust,
on permanent officers, who professed to understand
why the "Temporary" should be the
victim of sumptuary regulation, but not the
"pukka commission" man. All these officers
agreed that it was the wickedness of the
Temporary Second Lieutenant (otherwise Mr.
Pip-Squeak) that had caused all the trouble,
and could not understand why authority did not
recognise this view and make their new rules
apply only to the most junior officers. But the
rain of rules fell on the just and the unjust
alike, and some of the just were wroth.</p>

<p>I could sympathise a good deal, even if I
laughed a good deal more, at the officer who
found himself "treated like a child," as he put
it. The dignity of the position of a British
officer in the old Regular Army <i>qua</i> officer was
remarkable. His officer's rank gave him the
confidence of his banker, of his tradesmen, of
society generally. To see a British officer in
uniform with doubtful company or under
doubtful circumstances was almost unknown.
The tradition of the officer clan was jealously
guarded by the system of training. When at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
last, having got his commission, Mr. Regular
Pip-Squeak reported to his regiment in the old
days he found himself still very much in leading
strings. Until he had won six months' standing
his safest attitude, even in Mess, was that of
"don't speak unless you are spoken to."
Justice he could expect from his brother officers,
and sympathy too, but the sympathy was
tempered by severe snubbings to restrain any
tendencies to effervescence. Above all things,
he was trained to respect his uniform; and as he
had generally the right to wear mufti when off
duty, this high respect was more easy than in
war time, when uniform had to be almost
constantly worn.</p>

<p>With the first recruiting of the New Armies,
commissions were freely issued to men with no
training, and in some few cases with no
manners. For a little while a bewildered
public did not appreciate the change, and
bankers, tradesmen, hosts, had some unhappy
experiences. But what may be called the
"commercial" aspect of the question was soon
put right. Officers' rank ceased to give credit
rights. Socially, the readjustment was far
less easy. The War Office was at last compelled
to assist that process of readjustment with
various restrictive orders.</p>

<p>"We have been asking for it," commented
one officer grimly when some particularly
repressive regulations were published. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
without a doubt we had been asking for it&mdash;that
is to say the conduct of some officers had
made not merely advisable but necessary a
degree of motherly (or grandmotherly) supervision.
Exhortation preceded regulation by
many months.</p>

<p>Afterwards commissions were only granted
after some service or a Cadet term of training.
But the stringent regulations, which offended
the dignity of some "Regulars," remained. It
was not that a milk-sop standard was aimed at.
It was not the case that leave was only given to
go out to Mothers' Meetings, Sewing Circles,
and High Teas in Presbyteries. It was
recognised that boys will be boys. But there is a
time when parents must be parents; and the
War Office was in this case <i>in loco parentis</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But all that in 1918 was an old tale and
mostly a forgotten tale. At G.H.Q. there was
no scorn at all left for the Temporary who had
done his share of fighting, even when he joined
the scarlet-tabbed ranks of the elect. He was
accepted as a brother officer with the fullest
cordiality.</p>

<p>"Very much more interesting show, the
Army is now," confessed one Regular Colonel to
me. "Talk in Mess now <i>is</i> talk. You've no
idea how solemn and stuffy a Regular Mess
could be, say in India or in a garrison town."</p>

<p>There remained a little good-humoured chaff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
still for the Temporary who had jumped to a
high appointment without any real soldier life
at all. Brigadier-General &mdash;&mdash;, the eminent
expert in &mdash;&mdash;, who became a General very
suddenly, was reported to go around partly in
dreadful, partly in proud anticipation of a
guard turning out for him when he wandered
from G.H.Q. area.</p>

<p>The chaff was good-humoured. It was never
put under the nose of its object. So it did not
do much harm. In truth I was struck by the
general good temper with which the Trade
Union of Officers ultimately took its "dilutees."</p>

<p>But without a doubt the Officers' Trade
Union, or rather the Amalgamated Society of
Officers, Non-Commissioned Officers, and Men of
the Regular Army, was rather inclined to give
the cold shoulder to the "dilutees" in Lord
Kitchener's time. These New Army people
had not put in their proper term of apprenticeship,
had not paid their Union fees. Should
they be treated as full members of the Society?
But that feeling died away as the blood-bond of
a stubborn campaign broadened and stiffened.
It could not even be kept alive by the somewhat
silly advertisement in some quarters of
Territorial units and New Army units and
Colonial units at the expense of their Regular
brethren.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h4>G.H.Q. AND THE DOMINION ARMIES.</h4>

<h4>Our Parliament at the Club&mdash;A discussion of the
Dominions, particularly of Australia&mdash;Is the
Englishman shy or stand-offish?&mdash;How the
"Anzacs" came to be&mdash;The Empire after the
War.</h4>


<p>It was quite a little Parliament in its way, the
Officers' Club at Montreuil, and one of its pet
subjects of discussion was the Dominion soldier
and the effect that the campaign would have on
British Imperial relations. The talk covered a
wide field and was sprinkled with anecdotes; it
came up many evenings out of all sorts of
incidents.</p>

<p>"The Dominion men, many of them, are too
touchy," says an officer who has come back from
a <i>liaison</i> visit. "A Canadian officer&mdash;the talk
arising out of I do not know what incident&mdash;complained
to me to-day: 'The Canadians do
not seem to take on with the English.'
'Well, the Canadians have a very taking way
with them at the Front,' I replied, hoping the
allusion to Vimy Ridge would soothe him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
But it didn't. I hear from the Australians,
too, the same complaint&mdash;that the English
people 'do not like them.'"</p>

<p>"What greedy young men they are,"
comments another. "What more do they want
than the abject Anzac-worship and Canadian-worship
among the British people? If anything
ever went to the heart of the old Mother Country
and dimmed her spectacles for her, it was the
way in which the colonial troops came into the
fighting line."</p>

<p>A Dominion officer at the table hazards that
the British do seem "stand-offish" until you
know them.</p>

<p>A British officer explains that the English are
a shy people and a people with a high ideal of
personal liberty and individualism; that the
Englishman loves a corner seat in a train not so
much because it is more comfortable but because
it leaves his shyness, and his desire to keep
himself to himself, safe on one side; that he does
not like to be bothered, that he is very shy from
the fear of bothering other people. "Those
cold English passing you awkwardly by, my
huffy Australians or Canadians, are very proud
of you, and they do not go up to shake you by
the hand and say so because they fear you would
take it as a liberty."</p>

<p>A staff officer who did <i>liaison</i> work between
Australians and the British during the first
battle of the Somme thinks that one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
results of the Somme was the moulding during
its course of a truly Imperial Army. Forces of
differing types went into the cauldron. One
type came out. All did a full share in the
offensive, and by what they taught and by what
they learned had their influence in moulding
this "Imperial" Force. He blamed some
newspapers for having devoted well meant but
mischievous energy to spoiling the work of this
amalgamation. A good deal of newspaper effort,
if it had been taken seriously, he says, would
have fostered among the various troops a spirit
of third-class theatrical jealousy, as if they were
a mob of people competing for public favour and
public notice: "Since the issue has been raised
in other quarters, let it be said that between
Dominion troops and British troops there was a
fine emulation in skill and courage, and that no
sound judge could give the palm to any one
section over another. There were differences in
method of courage and skill, no differences in
degree."</p>

<p>We all agreed on that; and that the spirit of
comradeship between all was firm. Someone
noted as a curious thing that there seemed to be
an understanding that what is known among
soldiers as "chipping" should be dropped in
inter-imperial relations. A Durham might
explain&mdash;with no real but all apparent seriousness&mdash;how
lucky it was for the Yorks to have
the Durhams to lean upon; and the Yorks would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
respond in kind. In the next trenches a New-South-Waler
might, with a vigour that
concealed well the want of earnestness in his
<i>blague</i>, explain the hopelessness of the
Victorians. But between British, Canadian
and Australian this "chipping" was dropped.
They were good comrades, but felt that their
mutual intimacy had not yet grown to a stage
which allowed of "ragging" or "chipping."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Officers' Club G.H.Q. was inexhaustibly
interested in the "Anzacs." They were
frequently under discussion. There was far
more talk of them than of their fellow
colonials, the Canadians. They seemed to have
more dramatic interest. Their rakish hats
challenged notice, and their rakish actions.</p>

<p>Almost every day there was some fresh yarn
of the Anzacs, a yarn of some fine feat told
admiringly, a yarn of some classic bit of
impudence told tolerantly. One tells a tale of
the Anzacs' curious ideas of discipline. Another
caps this with the reminder that the Australian
corps has the best Salvage Record in the
Army&mdash;that is to say is the most industrious in
rag-picking, shell-case gathering, waste-paper
collecting, and so on.</p>

<p>"I don't wonder," the first speaker retorts.
"They're always after records. They'd go
over and raid the Boche trenches for Salvage
sooner than play second fiddle."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>"They did marvels saving the French harvest
this year under shell-fire."</p>

<p>"Yes, they are all right if you keep them
busy. But they are the very devil in rest camp.
Now in Cairo&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the table refuses to hear the story of
Cairo again, because it is not a very pleasant
story.</p>

<p>The conclusion I came to is that the British
officer had really a very soft spot in his heart for
the "wild Colonial boys"&mdash;Canadians and
Australians. I was always being appealed to,
as knowing Australia, to "explain" the
Anzac, which I did at great length on various
occasions, and here is the substance of it all:</p>

<p>The Anzac striding&mdash;or limping&mdash;along with
rakish hat and challenging glance, for the first
time brought Australasia actually home to the
Mother Country. These Australasians, the
men of the Bush, were as remarkable, as
significant almost, as the Dacians in the army of
another Imperial nation two thousand years
ago. Easily can they be picked out. They
walk the streets with a slightly obvious swagger.
When they are awed a little, it is a point of
honour not to show it. When they are critical
a little, it peeps out. Two by two, they keep
one another in countenance and are fairly
comfortable. Catch one alone and you may see
in his eyes a hunger for a mate, a need for some
other Anzac. For all his <i>bravura</i> air, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Anzac has no great self-confidence; and he has
a child's shy fear of making himself ridiculous
by a false step. The same fear makes him
difficult to know. He will often set up, as a
protective barrier against a real knowledge of
him, a stubborn taciturnity, or a garrulous flow
of what Australasians call "skite" and
Londoners call "swank."</p>

<p>In pre-war days an Australian in England
might have felt himself a little of the barbarian
in so smooth a comity, where people loved
moderately and hated very moderately; walked
always by paths; were somewhat ashamed of
their own merits and suavely tolerant of
others' demerits; and were nervous of allowing
patriotism to become infected with the sin of
pride. But England at war understood them
better&mdash;the Anzacs, the young of the British.
The young of the British, not of the English
only, though that is the master element of the
breed. The Anzac is a close mixture of English,
Scottish, Irish and Welsh colonists, with
practically no foreign taint.</p>

<p>There is, however, a wild strain in the
mixture. One of the first great tasks of
Australasia was to take the merino sheep of
Spain and make a new sheep of it&mdash;a task
brilliantly carried out. A concurrent task was
to take black sheep from the British Isles and
make good white stock out of them. The
success in this was just as complete. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
"rebels" of the Mother Country&mdash;Scottish
crofters, Irish agrarians, English Chartists
and poachers&mdash;mostly needed only full elbow
room to become useful men. Even for the
Micawbers a land of lots of room was
regenerative.</p>

<p>Was it Charles Lamb's quip that the early
population of the British Colonies should be
good "because it was sent out by the best
judges?" That was a truth spoken in jest.
The first wild strain was of notable value to a
new nation in the making. It came to
Australasia not only from the original settlers
but also from the rushes to the goldfields. And&mdash;note
here the first sign that the Anzac people
were to be dominated by the British spirit and
were to keep the law even while they forgot
conventions&mdash;there was never a Judge Lynch in
an Australasian mining camp. The King's
writ and Trial by Jury stood always.</p>

<p>The Anzac started thus with good blood. To
carry a study of the type to the next stage, to
note how the breed was influenced by environment,
it is necessary at the outset to put away
the idea that the Australasian people are
engaged, to the exclusion of all other interests,
in the task of subduing the wildnesses of their
continent. They have done, continue to do,
their pioneer work well, but have always kept
some time for the arts and humanities. To
ignore that fact is, I think, a common mistake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
even in the days when every European opera-house
of note had heard an Australasian singer
or musician, every European salon had shown
Australian pictures, and there was even a tiny
representation of Australian Art in pre-war
Montreuil.</p>

<p>"Does anybody in Australia then have time
to read Greek?" a schoolmaster's wife in
England asked once with surprise.</p>

<p>She was answered with another question:
"Who is the great Greek scholar of the day?"</p>

<p>"Professor Gilbert Murray."</p>

<p>"Well, he is an Australian."</p>

<p>It was a specious argument, for one swallow
does not make a summer. But the truth&mdash;that
Australasia produces at a high rate mental as
well as physical energy&mdash;could have been proved
categorically.</p>

<p>The Australian is not only a pioneer wrestling
with the wilderness. He is a creature of restless
mental energy, keenly (perhaps with something
of a spirit of vanity) eager to keep in the current
of world-thought, following closely not only his
own politics but also British and international
politics; a good patron of the arts; a fertile
producer and exporter of poetasters, minor
philosophers, scientists, writers, and artists.
There is nothing that the Anzac, nationally,
resents more than to be regarded as a mere
grower of wool and wheat, a hewer of wood and
digger of minerals. He aspires to share in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the things of life, to have ranches and
cathedrals, books and sheep. Above all,
perhaps, he has a passion for <i>la haute politique</i>.</p>

<p>All this was in the blood. The "wild
strain" was not only of men who found in the
old country a physical environment too narrow.
It was partly of men who desired a wider mental
horizon. Some very strange minor elements
would show out in a detailed analysis of
early Australasian immigration&mdash;disciples of
Fourier who gave up great possessions in
England to seek an idealistic Communism in the
Antipodes: recluse bookworms who thought
they could coil closer to their volumes in
primitive solitudes. But one element was
strong&mdash;the political and economic doctrinaire;
and the conditions of the new country
encouraged the growth of this element
particularly, so that Australia soon won quite
a fame for political inventions (<i>e.g.</i>, the
"Australian Ballot" and the "Torrens Land
Title"). But the general growth of what may
be termed a "thinking" class was encouraged
by the very isolation which, it would seem at
first thought, should have an opposite effect.
Whilst other young countries lost to older and
greater centres of population their young
ambitious men, Australasia's antipodean
position preserved her from the full extent of
the drain of that mental law of gravity which
makes the big populations attract the men who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
aspire to work with their brains more than with
their hands. Australasia will always be claiming
attention not only as a producer of wheat,
wool and well-knit men, but also of ideas.</p>

<p>The ideas of this young nation of the British,
nurtured in the Australasian environment,
would strike the pre-war England of five years
ago as naively reactionary. The Anzac, faced
by natural elements which are inexorably stern
to folly, to weakness, to indecision, but
which are generously responsive to capable
and dominating energy, had become more
resourceful, more resolute, more cruel, more
impatient than his British cousin. The men
who followed the drum of Drake were much
akin to the Australasian of to-day.</p>

<p>Australian Imperialism, in truth, must have
had for some years past a fussy air to the cooler
and calmer minds of England; though the good
sense and good humour of the Mother Country
rarely allowed this to be seen. When New
South Wales insisted on lending a hand in the
little Soudan War she was not snubbed. Nor
was Victoria, pressing at the same time a still
more unnecessary naval contingent. In the
South African War Australian eagerness to
take a part was more than generously
recognised, and when Australia next insisted on
giving help also in the suppression of the Boxer
Rising, room was patiently found for her naval
contingent.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>About this here is an illustrative story, which
is welcomed as "quite Australian." When
the Australian Gunboat "Protector" arrived
in Chinese waters the British admiral went on
board to pay his compliments and was not
stinting in praise of Australian military and
naval prowess. Thereupon the Australian
band is said to have struck up with a tune from
"The Belle of New York:" "Of course <i>you</i>
can never be quite like us."</p>

<p>It is perhaps a true story; certainly possible.
There is a touch of gay impudence in the
Australian character which an ex-Governor
confessed he loved "because it was so young."</p>

<p>Always one comes back to that word
"young." It is the key to an understanding
of the Anzac&mdash;youth with its enthusiasms,
rashnesses, faults, shynesses; youth, raw, if you
will, but of good breed and high intentions.</p>

<p>Australasian life leads to a certain hardness
of outlook. Life is prized, of course, but its
loss&mdash;either of one's own or of the other fellow's&mdash;is
not regarded with any superstitious horror.
Certainly it is not regarded as the greatest evil.
To go out with a mate and to come back without
him and under the slightest suspicion of not
having taken the full share of risk and
hardship would be counted greater. Living
close up to Nature (who can be very savage with
tortures of fire and thirst and flood), the back-country
Anzac&mdash;who sets the national type&mdash;must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
learn to be wary and enduring and sternly
true to the duties of mateship. The Bedouin of
tradition suggests the Anzac in his ideals of
mateship and of stoicism. The Anzac follows
the same desert school of chivalry in his love
for his horse and dog and his hospitality to the
stranger within his gates. He will share his
last water with the animal he is fond of; and in
the back-country the lonely huts of the boundary
riders are left open to any chance caller, with a
notice, perhaps, as to where to find the food
stores, and to "put the treacle back where the
ants cannot get to it." It is, of course, a point
of honour not to take except in case of need.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An English padre who put in two years in
the "Back of Beyond" of Australia as a
"Bush Brother" confesses that his first
impression was that the Anzac of the Bush was
cruel and pagan. His last impression was that
the Anzac was generally as fine a Christian as
any heaven for human beings would want. An
incident of this parson's "conversion" (he
related) was the entry into a far-back town of a
band of five men carrying another on a stretcher.
The six were opal miners with a little claim far
out in the desert. One had been very badly
mauled in an explosion. The others stopped
their profitable work at once and set themselves
to carry him in to the nearest township with a
hospital The distance was forty-five miles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
On the road some of the party almost perished
of thirst, but the wounded man had his drink
always, and always the bandages on his crushed
leg were kept moist in the fierce heat of the sun.
One of the men was asked how they had
managed to make this sacrifice.</p>

<p>"It was better to use the water that way
than to hear the poor blighter moan."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Many a night we speculated to what degree
the different Dominion types will approximate
as a result of this war. Certainly when the
Dominion and British troops were in contact
tidal currents of knowledge flowed to and fro
which left both the gainers. Points which had
been particular property became common:
regarding economy in the use of the water-bottle,
the art of making a bed in a shell-hole,
informal methods of acquiring horses, the best
tracks towards the soft side of Ordnance, the
true dignity of salutes, sniping as a sport, the
unpatriotism of recklessness, and other matters.
Slang was pooled and trench language much
enriched. In all things the essential kinship of
the British race was disclosed.</p>

<p>We agree that after the war, the British
Empire will have more of a general likeness.
Colonial ideas will have penetrated more
strongly into the Mother Country. British
ideas will have permeated the Colonial restlessness
and impatience. What an ideal race the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
British could be with a constant coming and
going from the Mother's home to the children's
houses; an exchange of good grey wisdom with
eager enthusiasm, the equable spirit of green
and cloudy England mingling with the ardency
of the Dominions.</p>

<p>Finally a Dominion officer sums up:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I do not think an Empire managed on the
old British lines could survive another great
shock. It is charming to be so equable and good-tempered
and to love your enemy as yourself
and to do good to those who hate you. But it
brings a nation too close to the fate which
overcame the Peruvians under the Incas (they
were a charmingly equable and good-tempered
and confiding race). Yet those who hope for an
Empire managed on Canadian lines, or on
Australian lines, leave me cold. I want good
wheat crops and cathedrals, the best of the new
and of the old spirit. And just as the sole real
advantages of being rich are that one can be
honest and generous, there would be no use at
all in being a great Empire and yet not feeling
strong enough to 'play the game' fairly and
chivalrously. I hate hearing the talk&mdash;which
is the swing back from the excess of British
tolerance&mdash;of a cold-blooded and merciless
efficiency as the ideal of national life. Better
to perish than to be a German Empire
trampling on the faces of women and babes to
the throne of power."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h4>EDUCATING THE ARMY.</h4>

<h4>The beginning of an interesting movement&mdash;The
work of a few enthusiasts&mdash;The unexpected peace&mdash;Humours
of lectures to the Army&mdash;Books for the
Army&mdash;The Army Printery.</h4>


<p>In the last phase of the war G.H.Q. saw
a remarkable new development in Army
organisation: the inclusion of civic education
as part of the soldier's Army course. Before
this war, of course, there had been Army schoolmasters,
and these in peace time did valuable
work in teaching illiterate soldiers. Cobbett,
we know, owed his education to the Army;
so did one of the famous Generals of this war,
Sir William Robertson; and once we had as a
visitor and lecturer at G.H.Q. an American
University Professor whose first education had
been won as a ranker in the British Army.</p>

<p>But the new Education Scheme had a much
wider scope than the old Army schools. The
plan in brief was to make civic education a
definite and compulsory part of Army life, so
that every man joining the Army should have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
course of humane and technical or professional
education. The plan is now in course of being
carried on to successful fruition, and in the
future the Army will be a Continuation School
as well as a defence service.</p>

<p>This may prove to be one of the most useful
results of the war. It was due to the
enthusiasm of a little band of soldiers and
civilians, the leaders of which were Colonel
Borden Turner, Major-General Bonham-Carter,
Colonel Lord Gorell and Sir Henry Hadow.</p>

<p>The Army Educational movement had a small
beginning with the organisation of lectures.
After the fighting of 1917 it was felt that
something more than the usual round of cinema
shows and the performances of Divisional
theatrical troupes was necessary to help to
recreate the fighting value of the Army, and
that what was required was something more
solid and intellectual, something that would
raise an interest in civic subjects quite apart
from the war. It was therefore decided to get
as many scholars as possible to come out and
give lectures to the men. During the previous
winter the Y.M.C.A. had arranged for a few
lecturers to come out and lecture in back areas,
and they had machinery already existing for
looking after them in France. The Y.M.C.A.
now again undertook the work of housing,
feeding, and transporting the lecturers in
France, and for all arrangements for getting
them to the country. Major-General Bonham-Carter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
persuaded some of the Government
offices, viz., Reconstruction, Food Control,
Pensions, Labour, Education, to send out men
who could help the movement; and Lieutenant-Colonel
(then Captain) Borden Turner came to
G.H.Q. to supervise the details. All arrangements
for lectures were made by the General
Staff with the Y.M.C.A. Lecturers were sent
to units in the fighting areas rather than to the
Lines of Communication.</p>

<span class="caption">MAJOR-GENERAL C. BONHAM CARTER</span>
</div>

<p>Later on it was decided that we must have
an organisation to carry out a big scheme of
general education directly an armistice was
declared, so that the time of the men might
be profitably employed while waiting for
demobilisation after the fighting was over. This
decision was made in December, 1917. Major-General
Bonham-Carter and Captain Borden
Turner worked out a scheme with this idea, and
Sir Henry Hadow, an educationalist of great
renown, gave his assistance.</p>

<p>Already efforts in this direction had been
made in England and in the Canadian Corps
and elsewhere by individuals, to provide
facilities for education and hold classes, and a
few voluntary classes were being held by the
Y.M.C.A. There was, however, no organised
effort anywhere except in the Canadian Corps.</p>

<p>In January, 1918, it was decided to get the
scheme started as early as possible and not wait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
for the Armistice. But at that time there was
a great shortage of men, and naturally any
scheme which demanded new establishments met
with objections. For this reason things moved
slowly. However, a scheme was got ready,
waiting for the favourable moment to arrive.
It arrived sooner than was expected. At an
historic dinner one night at Lord Haig's
château his personal enthusiasm was aroused,
and he gave orders for the preparation of a
scheme for general education throughout the
Army in France with the object (1) of making
men better citizens of the Empire, by widening
their outlook and knowledge, (2) of helping
them by preparing them for their return to
civil life.</p>

<p>Lord Haig approved of the scheme that had
already been prepared, but it was put into force
slowly, because very few men could be spared
from fighting and Lines of Communication work
to fill the establishments required. But a start
was made. The scheme arranged for the work
to be administered by General Staff officers and
attached officers in all Formations, but on the
Lines of Communication the Y.M.C.A. carried
out all teaching work as agents of the General
Staff.</p>

<p>In April, 1918, it was realised that the efforts
in France would be greatly hampered if they
were not co-ordinated with those in England
and elsewhere. The War Office was therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
urged to undertake this co-ordinating work.
Lord Gorell, who was at that time working
under Major-General Bonham-Carter in the
Training Branch at G.H.Q., was appointed to
the War Office for the purpose.</p>

<p>The Army Education movement had warm
sympathy from those at the head of affairs.
The Commander-in-Chief when once it was put
before him was enthusiastic. So was Lord
Milner, then Secretary of State for War; and
Sir Travers Clarke, Q.M.G. and Major-General
Daunay (Staff Duties) gave it every support.
But it was a movement from below rather than
from above, a movement springing from a
widely-spread feeling amongst the soldiers that
they should win some better outlook on life
from their term in the Army.</p>

<p>If one man more than another should be
singled out in this movement, which really
sprang from spontaneous generation, it would
be Borden Turner. He had the crusading spirit
and preached Education to every authority until
what was a vague aspiration came to be a
concrete fact. Certainly Borden Turner was a
scarcely tolerable friend to many of the already
over-busy officers at G.H.Q. He was always
urging them to give lectures, to take on classes.
At this time there was practically no
"Establishment," and the only hope was to get
officers to give spare time to educational work.
They had no spare time, but at the remorseless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
urging of Borden Turner they stole hours from
sleep or from the Ramparts and gave lectures or
took classes.</p>

<p>Before the Armistice the Organisation of the
Education Branch had progressed to some
extent. Lord Gorell had gone to London and
found a sympathetic leader in Major-General
Lyndon Bell, the Director of Staff Duties, War
Office, and S.D. 8 was established, having as
its chief officers under Lord Gorell, Sir Henry
Hadow, Colonel Sir Theo. Morrison, Major
Basil Williams (the writer of a famous Life of
Chatham), and Major Frank Fox. General
Bonham-Carter and Lieutenant-Colonel Borden
Turner remained in France, and the work
of the new branch was being established and
co-ordinated with that of the Y.M.C.A. and
with the Canadian, Australian, and New
Zealand Army Education schemes when the
German unexpectedly threw in his hand. A
feverish rush for demobilisation at once set in.
As a consequence of newspaper agitation the
original demobilisation plans were seriously
upset, and one of the worst sufferers was the
Army Education movement. Still an amount
of useful work both on the humane and the
technical side was effected. Best of all, the
principle was firmly established that if a nation
takes away a young citizen from civil life it
owes it to him that when the time comes to send
him back to civil life it will not be into a blind
alley; his term in the army will be employed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
make a sound citizen of him and to give him
training in some vocation.</p>

<p><a name="i_0267"></a></p>

<span class="caption">LIEUT-COLONEL D. BORDEN TURNER</span>
</div>

<p>The Army Education organisation set itself
to search out teaching talent in the Army before
calling in outside assistance, and it made some
interesting finds. Many a University don was
discovered in a very humble position. A
gentleman described as "one of the most
learned men in Europe" was a bombardier in a
battery. N.C.O.s and rankers who were
Fellows of famous colleges were common
enough. Most of them were drawn into the
Education organisation.</p>

<p>One of the officers taken by Education from
G.H.Q., where he was a staff captain in the
Adjutant General's Branch, was Captain
Hansell, who had been the Prince of Wales'
tutor in his student days. Hansell, in addition
to his scholarship, is a sagacious urbane
diplomat with a deep and sympathetic
knowledge of French life. He would have been
best placed on the Military Mission to the
French Army. But that would have been a
serious loss if it had taken him away from
G.H.Q., where his after-dinner talk cheered
the seniors and his artful unobtrusive tutelage
helped the juniors. Captain Hansell took
charge of the Lecturers' Headquarters for
Education, and the task must have made a
very heavy demand on his tact. Lecturers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
all kinds were being sent out to France to
address the troops, some of them with very
vague notions of what was required of them in
the way of kit. One lecturer vastly pleased his
soldier audiences, but imposed a heavy strain
on transport by always appearing on the
platform in full evening dress. Another
lecturer went out&mdash;in a Flanders winter&mdash;with
a frock-coat as his warmest garment, "and it
was the thinnest frock-coat in Christendom,"
observed a sympathiser. Of course a very great
deal of "roughing it" was the lot of the
lecturer going from unit to unit to troops living
under active service conditions.</p>

<p>Moreover organisation was not perfect at the
time. At one period a steady stream of
lecturers was arriving at Lecturers' Headquarters
but none was going out to lecture,
because all transport for the time was absorbed
in a particularly heavy phase of demobilisation.
The lecturers, on whose damask periods idleness
was as a cankering worm in the bud, got into a
sad state of impatience and were threatening
to lecture one another, or do something else
desperate, when the position was saved by a
timely visit to them of the Prince of Wales and
his brother, Prince Albert, who had tea with
them, chatted over their work, and convinced
them that they were not out on a fool's errand.
Shortly afterwards the transport situation was
relieved, and the lecturers rushed to their
audiences and peace reigned again. But it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
dreadful to think of what might have happened
if there had not been the urbane and diplomatic
Captain Hansell smoothing over troubles. A
mutiny of lecturers would have afforded some
puzzling problems to the Provost-Marshal.</p>

<p>Before the Army Education organisation was
born a great number of men in the Army did
some good solid reading. The Camps Libraries
organisation in England sent out to every unit
parcels of books. Most of these were of the
opiate class, light magazines and light stories
intended to bemuse and not to educate the mind.
But a proportion of good books slipped in and
were warmly appreciated by some.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Army itself had a very fecund printing
press, but it was devoted almost solely to the
production of books of orders and regulations
and text books. Regimental annuals of a
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'humourous'">humorous</ins>
kind existed but were not
encouraged. As a rule they were printed in
England, not in France, and the conditions of
censorship&mdash;more perhaps than the taste of
writers and readers&mdash;confined them as a rule to
somewhat feeble japes.</p>

<p>There were very often mooted proposals for a
G.H.Q. Monthly. It might have drawn on a
very distinguished band of writers. But
authority contrived that these proposals should
never come to maturity. The expenditure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
time and material was grudged, and G.H.Q.
was naturally very nervous on points of
"Intelligence." There are a thousand and
one ways in which military secrets can be
given away with quite harmless intent. An
Intelligence General's aphorism on this point
ran: "We find out far more from the stupidity
of our enemies than from the cleverness of our
spies."</p>

<p>It is clear that silence is the one sound policy.
If a man says nothing, nothing can be
discovered from him. If he will speak, even
if it is only with the intention of deceiving, he
may disclose something. British diplomacy
abroad (which was not such a foolish show as
some critics say, or else how comes it that the
British Empire, from the tiny foundation of
these islands, has come to its present greatness?)
was always the despair of the inquisitive
Foreign Correspondent, for it never said
anything. An Embassy or Ministry which
would tell a lie, especially an elaborate lie, was
far preferable, for from something you may
deduce something; from nothing, nothing.
G.H.Q. acted with a sound discretion in
smothering all proposals for a G.H.Q. Monthly.</p>

<p>The Army did most of its own printing, of
maps, orders, forms, and training books. Maps
were done by the R.E. mapping section, other
printing by the Army Printing and Stationery
Services under Colonel Partridge. This was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
highly efficient department with printing
presses of the most modern type at Boulogne,
Abbéville, and elsewhere. A.P. and S.S.
printed daily General Routine Orders and, as
occasion demanded, poured out in millions
Army Forms, posters, pamphlets, and books.
Both the French and Americans used its
services. It could print in Chinese and Arabic
as well as in European characters, and some of
its achievements in the way of quick and good
printing would do credit to a big London
printing house.</p>

<p>The Boulogne Printing Press, which was
under the care of Major Bourne, was a
particularly up-to-date establishment much
praised by the Americans and the French as
well as by our own Army. It put a strain
once, however, on the politeness of the French.
The French Mission at G.H.Q. wanted a book
printed giving a record of its organisation.
A.P. and S.S., in the right spirit, did its best
to make the book a handsome one, and designed
a special cover with <i>fleur-de-lys</i> decorations.
The French Mission, with tact but with firmness,
pointed out that France was now a Republic
and a monarchical symbol could hardly
be permitted on an official publication. It
might give rise to a suspicion that the Army
contemplated a <i>coup d'état</i>. The printers
regretted and tried again. The second cover
design bore the good old Roman Republican<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
device of the lictors' fasces. But they were
shown reversed. The French were desolated at
being so exiguous, but could something else be
tried, just plain type? The printers were
determined, however, to give the good French
something to show what an artistic people we
English really are, and made a third effort
at a decorated cover. This showed a really
charming design in which the Gallic Cock
strutted triumphantly along a rose-point border.
The French were enchanted, so enchanted that
they found reason to have another book, an
annexe to the original book, printed with the
same cover.</p>

<p>American Army publications were normally
somewhat more solemn and staid than our own.
Occasionally, however, the American humour
broke out, as in the gas warning leaflet, which
had not, perhaps, the sanction of American
G.H.Q. but was widely (and usefully) circulated
in the trenches. It began:&mdash;</p>

<span>Be Quick and get that Gas Mask on!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After the Armistice, the Printing Services,
no longer so much pressed with other Army
work, were able to undertake some purely
educational printing. But by this time
demobilisation was sweeping away the classes,
and the best of the opportunity had passed.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

collapse of Russia&mdash;The Cambrai Battle&mdash;The
German propaganda&mdash;Fears of irresolution at
Home&mdash;Reassurances from Home&mdash;Effects of the

<p>The Somme campaign, 1916, had been begun
with very high hopes. The main conception of
it was a sound one, to attack the German line at
the point of junction between the French and
British forces, the point where, according to
all the accepted principles, the Allied line
should have been weakest but actually was not.
That was the only way to bring an element of
the unexpected into a grand attack in those days
of long and laborious artillery preparations.
(The Tank did not appear on the scene until
the Battle of the Somme was two months old
and did not develop its usefulness as a substitute
for artillery preparation until nearly a year
later).</p>

<p>For the Somme battle an enormous artillery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
concentration was made, and a special "Army
of Pursuit" was trained in the rear of our lines
to follow through when the German line had
been breached. Then there was a preliminary
bombardment of the German positions from the
sea to beyond the Somme, and, amidst many
feint attacks, the British and the French
offensive north and south of the Somme was
launched.</p>

<p>The First Battle of the Somme made the walls
of Jericho quake but just failed to bring them
down. The Army of Pursuit was given no
chance of pushing to the Rhine; its energies
had to be diverted towards sustaining the
attack. The fighting season closed in 1916
with the Germans still holding their main
defences but convinced, so far as the reasonable
section of their leaders were concerned, that the
game was up and that the best thing to do was
to work for a peace on the best terms possible.</p>

<p><a name="i_0279"></a></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/page_0279.jpg" width="600" height="395" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">ON THE RAMPARTS</span>
</div>

<p>Thus 1916 was a somewhat disappointing
year; 1917 was even more so. The fighting
season, that year, closed with the Allied cause
in a worse position than in 1916 and with
Germany correspondingly encouraged. There
would have been some reasonable excuse if in the
winter of 1917-18 tails drooped at G.H.Q.
The weather was particularly vile. Every day
the winds that howled over the bleak hill-top
seemed to have come straight from Russia and
Germany, bringing with them a moral as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
as a physical cold. The casualty lists of the
Autumn were not cheerful to ponder over; and
it was singularly depressing to hear from Home
that in some political circles those casualty
lists were being conned over with the idea of
founding on them a case against the Army.</p>

<p>Nobody was inclined to try to represent
the late Autumn campaign as altogether
satisfactory. But it was felt by the soldiers
that "they had done their durn'dest, angels
can do no more;" and that there was not
sufficient appreciation of the fact at Home that
with Russia down and out, France in a very bad
way, Italy tottering, the British Army had had
to step into the breach, had had to take a
gruelling without being able to accomplish
much more than defence.</p>

<p>It had seemed in 1916 that the time had
arrived for Germany to pay the penalty. But
a triumph not of a military kind came to her
rescue. The German methods of espionage and
civil corruption were on the whole as blundering
and as disastrous as her other methods during
the Great War. They helped to alienate
practically all the civilised neutral world. But
in Russia&mdash;mystic, generous, trusting Russia&mdash;they
had an unhappy success. In the Autumn
of 1916 this first showed. Roumania at that
time joined in the war against Germany, and
this new accession of strength apparently
marked the near end of the war. But Russia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
mysteriously collapsed owing to the effects of
German corruption. Roumania was left "in
the air," and a large part of her territory was
over-run. From this date, though many of the
gallant soldiers of Russia made heroic efforts to
safeguard their country's honour, that great
Ally was practically out of the fight. By the
winter of 1917-18 she was quite out. The
French had had grave troubles. The Italians
had had to send out an S.O.S. signal.</p>

<p>We should have been more cheerful if the
Cambrai attack, 1917, had had the full success
it deserved. That really was in its conception
and execution a very fine affair. At the time
Germany was drawing troops and guns from the
Russian Front and pouring them on to our
Front in wholesale fashion. Both France and
Great Britain had had to send Armies to the
help of Italy. Our Battle of Passchendaele
was not exactly flourishing. To undertake a
new battle was the last development the enemy
expected of us; and to do what is absolutely
unexpected is to do the big thing in war. The
British command collected an Army ostensibly
for Italy, made a great secret assemblage of
Tanks, and suddenly attacked the Germans in
the strongest part of their Hindenburg line.
Their line was particularly strong at that point.
It comprised three series of defences each one
covered by triple barriers of wire from 50 to 60
yards deep. A system of dug-outs (constructed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
with the labour of Russian prisoners) at a depth
of 50 feet below the surface made an underground
city with water and electric light
installations, kitchens, drying-rooms and the
like. Above the surface the houses were
closely packed with the earth removed from the
excavations, and thus became great earthworks
indestructible by any shell-fire.</p>

<p>All this the British Third Army, in a surprise
attack carried out by the Tanks and the
Infantry, over-ran and captured in a day's
attack. So fierce was the British advance and
so feeble the German defence <i>when taken by
surprise</i> that we almost got into Cambrai. If
that centre had been won the German Front in
the West would have been deprived of its central
pillar. The German defence, however, rallied
in time to avoid absolute disaster. When the
German military mind was given time to think
it could always make a good show, and the
<i>riposte</i> to our Cambrai attack was a good one.
We lost most of the fruits of a dramatic <i>coup</i>.
It was more than annoying to think that just
when we had successfully solved the problem of
a break-through we had not the means, owing to
commitments elsewhere, to push the thrust
home.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Cambrai was a good deal "boomed" in the
English Press at the time on "popular" lines.
But I do not think that the skill of generalship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
and organisation that it showed were quite
appreciated. The favourite British pose of
being a complete ass, altogether inferior to the
"other fellow," used to be pushed to the
extreme point in regard to military matters.
The British had a quaint humility in respect to
their military skill. In a shame-faced kind of
way they admitted that their soldiers were
brave; but for examples of military genius they
always referred to the "other fellow." Yet
one may be daring enough, perhaps, to say
something on the other side; and to suggest that
in the Great War the German was really
surpassed in most points of military skill by
the British. The difference was not always
great, but where the difference was greatest was
just in those points of invention, of new tactics
and new strategy, which show the better brain.
Heresy it will seem; but the truth is that from
1914 to 1918 the British military system showed
itself superior to the German in resource and
sagacity. Perhaps it would be better to say the
British-French military system, for it is
difficult to separate the achievement of one from
the other.</p>

<p>Consider one by one the main features of the
great campaign. The warfare in the air was
its most dramatic feature. Everything of air
tactics and strategy that the German used he
copied from the British and French. It was
the British who originated aeroplane attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
with incendiary bullets on captive balloons,
aeroplane escort of attacking infantry,
aeroplane sallies at low altitude on enemy
trenches, and the various combinations of
observing machines with fighting machines.
In the first battle of the Somme, when the
British and French first disclosed their sky
tactics, the German was absolutely driven out of
the air. He had then to learn to copy all our
methods; and he originated none of his own.</p>

<p>Another dramatic feature, the complicated
and terribly effective artillery curtain fire, was
evolved by the British-French command. It
was copied by the Germans, who themselves
contributed nothing new to artillery science
during the war. Yet another leading feature
was the Tank, the Tank which made its real
value first felt at Cambrai. This was a purely
British invention, evolved during this war for
the needs of this war.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Our "Winter of discontent" was not made
any sweeter by the suspicion that existed of a
possible yielding on the part of the political
powers at Home to German propaganda. This
German propaganda took the form of blazoning
the preparations for a sensational Spring
offensive in 1918; it was trumpeted like a Fat
Woman at a Fair, and supplemented by an
almost equally strident advertisement of a
gigantic defensive. In addition to preparing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
great on-rush in which Calais, Paris, Rome,
and perhaps London were to be captured, the
German High Command wished the world to
know that it was also preparing a mighty series
of defensive positions back to the Rhine.
Wonderful showmen! They had not only the
most marvellous Fat Woman, but also a
miraculous Skeleton Man. And the prize they
wished to win, by bluff if not by fighting, was
agreement to an inconclusive peace.</p>

<p>The soldiers were not affected much by these
tactics. They took solid comfort from two
facts. The first fact was expressed in the
homely proverb "Much cry, little wool." Had
the Germans been confident that they could
smash through the steel wall which barred them
on the West from the sea, from the capitals of
civilisation, and from the supplies of raw
material for which they were starving, there
would have been no preliminary advertisement.
The effort would have been made, and
Germany's enemies would have had to abide by
the result. There would not have been any
compunction at the consequent cost in blood.
The mere extravagance of the advertisement of
the German plans was proof to the soldiers at
G.H.Q. that those plans were recognised not to
have a solid enough military foundation, and
had to be reinforced by showy bluff.</p>

<p>The second fact which gave solid comfort was
that in any comparison at all of forces the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
German group was inferior to the West
European-American group. There was not any
doubt at G.H.Q. Indeed the more the
Germans protested of what they were going to
do in the Spring of 1918 the more firm was
G.H.Q. in believing that the enemy was at last
coming to the end of his resources and was
anxious to "bluff" a peace rather than
"show" a weak hand.</p>

<p>But it was feared that the people at Home
might take the other view, and it had to be
admitted that the German put up a very strong
bluff. Perhaps its cleverest form at the time
was in the discussion of "peace terms"&mdash;a
discussion in which it was presumed that the
German would impose a victorious peace before
the summer of 1918. A characteristic discussion&mdash;G.H.Q.
kept a close eye on the German press
and minutely examined every German paper
published during the war&mdash;would begin with
some Prince pointing out the minimum
indemnity that Germany should exact from her
foes, and explaining in what form it should be
exacted. Germany's need, it would be pointed
out, would be for raw materials, food, cotton,
wool, rubber, tobacco, silk and the like. It
was these that must be supplied to Germany by
way of indemnity. They would have to be
supplied not free, but at a price 20 per cent.
lower than the current market price, and the
annual value of this discount would only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
reach the modest sum of £50,000,000 a year.</p>

<p>To have had to provide yearly a tribute of any
kind to Germany would of course have taken
away the independence of the Allies completely.
They would have been put in the position of
admitting a German
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'suzerainity'">suzerainity</ins>,
and would
have become as the oppressed Christian
provinces of the old Turkish Empire. But to
provide this tribute of raw material, the
discount on which at 20 per cent. would be
£50,000,000 a year, would have been to engage
to send to Germany yearly raw materials of her
choice to the value of £250,000,000. This would
have been the first call on the farms, the mines,
the shipping of the Allies, and only after that
call was met would the Allies have been able to
begin to supply their own larders and their own
factories.</p>

<p>That was one direction the German Peace
Propaganda took. The idea of it was,
presumably, to strike terror into our hearts,
to make us welcome with something like relief
the actual official terms of a peace negotiation
when they came to be promulgated.</p>

<p>Then someone in Germany would take
the other side. Assuming with absolute
cock-sureness that Germany must win the
war in the Spring of 1918, this publicist
would affect to regret the savage terms
of peace imposed upon Russia. These terms,
it was argued, did not represent the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>sidered
wishes of the German people. But
in war the wisdom of the statesmen was
pushed aside by the eagerness of the soldiers.
The German politicians were overwhelmed in
regard to the Russian peace because the Russian
had allowed things to go too far. But if only
the Western Powers would agree to negotiate
for peace <i>now</i>, the "reasonable German
politicians" would be able to assert their
authority. There would be no ruthless military
conditions such as were imposed upon Russia.
Sweetly and moderately the Germans would
frame their terms; but the Powers of the
Entente must "put the war into liquidation at
once." Delay would mean that the "reasonable
German politicians" would lose their power to
restrain the military party.</p>

<p>G.H.Q. remembered the old fable about
certain trustful animals being invited to pay
friendly visits to the cave of a beast of prey.
One wise animal noticed that whilst there were
many tracks of visitors going into the cave there
were no tracks of visitors coming out. We
had noticed that a free Russia went into
negotiation with Germany to conclude a
friendly and reasonable peace on terms of "no
annexations and no indemnities." No free
Russia came out.</p>

<p>But G.H.Q. was honestly alarmed for a time
that resolution would be shaken at Home, and
welcomed with joy (as the Germans did with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
rage), the firm declarations of the Versailles
Council of the Allies and the unshaken
confidence and resolution shown in the speech
from the Throne at the prorogation of the
British Parliament.</p>

<p>As soon as the Home political situation was
seen to be clear, G.H.Q. set about preparing for
the "wrath to come" with a good deal of
cheerfulness and with some amusement that the
German propaganda should, as a final kick,
make a strong though forlorn effort to revive
the old story that Great Britain contemplated
the seizure from France of Calais and the
department of Pas-de-Calais. "Even," said
the German Wireless about this time, "if it is
not openly admitted that the English will never
voluntarily evacuate the French port of Calais,
which they have occupied&mdash;" etc., etc.</p>

<p>This lie revived in our Mess between British
and French <i>liaison</i> officers an old topic of
humorous conversation. For when this
particular lie was burdening the German
Wireless some time before, a British General
was showing to a French General the
arrangements of the British Base at Etaples.
He exhibited with pride the great bath houses
for the men, built of concrete and "good for a
hundred years." "Ah yes, very solid&mdash;good
for a hundred years," said the French General,
laughing. Then they both laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Christmas, 1917, was celebrated with the
usual British merriment at G.H.Q., and on
New Year's Day everybody's cheerful greeting
was "That this year may see the end of the
war." But I think there were few officers of
standing who thought that a peace Christmas
was possible in 1918. No one would contemplate
the possibility of losing the war, of stopping on
any terms short of a German surrender; but
few could see any possibility of victory near
ahead. There were thick clouds all round the
horizon. Russia was finished. Italy was not
cheerful. France was recovering but not yet
showing sure signs of emergence from that
fit of depression out of which M. Clemenceau
was to pull her&mdash;the soul of a Richelieu in his
frail body.</p>

<p>The worst symptom of all from the point of
view of the British Army was the threat of a
shortness of supplies. Just when the collapse
of Russia had allowed the enemy to concentrate
his full strength on the Western Front, the
great reservoir of British wealth, which was the
main financial resource of the Alliance, showed
signs of not being inexhaustible. There was a
call at the same time for greater preparation
and greater economy. From the beginning of
1918 there were two great cross-currents of
correspondence between G.H.Q. and the Home
Government, one demanding new weapons, new
defences, new equipment, the other demanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
rigid economy in steel, in timber, in shipping
space, in food, in oil, in expenditure generally.
This was partly due to actual lack of money and
of credit. But in the main it was the result of
the submarine war.</p>

<p>It was at the end of 1915 that the German
Admiralty prepared a memorandum arguing
that if unrestricted submarine war were adopted
as a policy (<i>i.e.</i>, sinking everything, hostile or
neutral, warship or passenger ship), then
Great Britain would be compelled to sue for
peace within six months. The memorandum
gave various statistics regarding food supplies,
tonnage, etc., to prove this hypothesis. The
memorandum was forwarded to the Imperial
Chancellor, and by him sent to Dr. Helfferich,
Secretary of State for Finance, for a report.
Dr. Helfferich reported adversely. He was not
convinced that Great Britain would be brought
to her knees. He feared the effect upon neutral
nations of such a policy.</p>

<p>The German Admiralty persisted in its view.
Thereupon the matter was submitted for report
to ten experts representing finance, commerce,
mining, and agriculture. These experts were
asked to advise (1) as to the probable effect upon
Great Britain (2) as to the probable effect upon
Germany's relations with neutrals and (3) as to
how far the situation in Germany demanded
the employment of such a weapon.</p>

<p>All these experts agreed that the effect on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Great Britain would be to force her to sue
for peace within six months or less. Indeed,
Herr Müller, President of the Dresden Bank,
thought that Great Britain would collapse
within three months. All the experts also
agreed as to the third point of reference,
arguing that Germany's position was so
difficult that the most desperate measures were
necessary to end the war. Herr Engelhardt, of
Mannheim, Councillor of Commerce, thought
the economic position of Germany so bad that
a few weeks' delay might render even ruthless
submarine war useless. On the second point,
the effect on relations with neutrals, the experts
were divided. Some thought that the United
States would be driven to war, others thought
not. In all cases they did not see a reason
against ruthless submarine war in their possible
relations with any neutral.</p>

<p>But the fateful decision was not taken until
February, 1917, when the destruction of
peaceful shipping, whether of enemy or of
neutral countries, was ordered. It did not end
the war in six months, nor in twelve months;
but by the beginning of 1918 there were some
very serious difficulties of supply just when the
strictly military position demanded the most
generous effort.</p>

<p>I wonder if those experts who bandy to and
fro explanations and accusations in regard to
the German break-through in the Spring of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
1918 ever have looked at the matter from the
point of view of supply, of the supply, say, of
one sternly necessary item of defence, wire?
At a careful computation we wanted 12,000
tons of barbed wire in January, 1918, and
10,000 more tons in February, 1918, to give our
men a reasonable chance of holding the line
which we knew to be threatened. Of that total
of 22,000 tons we actually got 7,700 tons, <i>i.e.</i>,
35 per cent. of what was needed.</p>

<p>I do not quote this fact to start another
quarrel, shuttle-cocking blame from soldier to
politician. I am more than ready to believe
that the people at Home were then doing their
best (as, <i>pace</i> all grousers, I believe they did
their best from August, 1914, to November,
1918). But you cannot spin out wire like you
spin out talk, especially barbed wire. The
British soldier can, with his mere flesh and
blood, and that gay courage of his, do wonders
in the way of making up for want of material.
But he could not hold up the attacked sector in
the Spring of 1918 against overwhelming odds;
and one of the reasons was that he had not
enough wire in front of him. He had not the
wire in front of him because it had not been,
<i>could not be</i>, supplied.</p>

<p>How anxious was the task of G.H.Q.
at the dawn of 1918 may be illustrated
with these heads of correspondence, in and
out.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>I could fill many pages with matter of the
same sort. The poison of the submarine war
began to have its cumulative effect just when
we were getting the most peremptory reminders
that Supply was going to be the determining
factor of the final struggle, that war had become
more and more a matter of striking at the
enemy's life by striking at "the means whereby
he lives." Munitions, food, equipment,
railways, roads, ships&mdash;these had become the
most important factors, and victory would
incline to the Force which could best concentrate
the means to maintain an overwhelming force
at some particular point, which could best
develop, conserve, and transport its material.
The field for the strategist had moved more and
more from the Front line towards the Base.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the British Army in France had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
for its Q.M.G. at this crisis a man with the
courage and the knowledge to carry through a
drastic reorganisation of the Supply and
Transport services. Lieutenant-General Sir
Travers Clarke, who took over as Q.M.G.,
France, at the end of 1917, was a daring experiment
on Lord Haig's part; for he was a comparative
youngster to be put into a post which
was then the most anxious and onerous in the
Army, and his actual substantive rank was that
of a major; but he was an acting Major-General
with a fine record in a minor theatre of the war.
Lord Haig knew his man well, though, and,
what was just as necessary, knew how to back
his man. He put Sir Travers Clarke in the
saddle and kept him there in spite, I have no
doubt, of many thunderous protests from
influential quarters, for Sir Travers Clarke
was a ruthless reformer and a stubborn upholder
of any course of action he thought necessary.
A character sketch of him that appeared in the
<i>Morning Post</i> in 1919 is worth quoting in part:</p>

<span class="caption">LIEUT-GENERAL SIR TRAVERS CLARKE</span>
</div>

<p>"'That big young man,' was a leading
American officer's term to describe Sir Travers
Clarke after he had met him in France in
Conference, and had not caught his name.
British G.H.Q. perhaps only learned to
appreciate the Q.M.G. fully from the comments
of foreign officers who came into touch with him
in 1918. The masterful man took his power so
quietly, came to big decisions with such an air
of ease, such an absence of anything dramatic or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
violent, that it was a little difficult to understand
his full strength.</p>

<p>"'T.C.'&mdash;as often before remarked, the
British Army must reduce everything and
everyone to initials&mdash;as a regimental officer in
the 'Nineties never seemed to get an opening.
Nor did his early Staff work bring him much
recognition. But an officer of his to-day, who
was a clerk under him when he was first a
Staff Captain, insists that he always gave the
impression of great power in reserve. 'He
believed in the British Army, in hard work, and
in himself.' That was the foundation of the
career of a man who, once an opening showed,
forged ahead with marvellous speed to his
destiny.</p>

<p>"It took 'T.C.' ten years to become a major;
within the next ten years he had become
Lieutenant-General and Quartermaster-General
to the British Armies in France. One year in
that post, a year in which were crowded all the
experiences that a great Army could have,
marked him as a great leader of men and a
superb organiser. How much the Allied victory
owes to him a grateful country will not
appreciate fully until not only the British but
also the French and American campaigns are
analysed.</p>

<p>"'T.C.' had the ideal personality for a
military leader. You were always dreadfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
afraid of him and sincerely fond of him. No
general ever made sterner demands on his
officers and men. If you could not stand up to
a gruelling day's work and come up smiling for
the next day's and the next day's, until the
need had passed, you were no use, and you
moved on to some less exacting sphere. But
you were working under a worker, and you
found yourself part of a massive machine which
was rolling flat all obstacles. That made it
easy. Further, there was the most generous
appreciation of good work and a keen personal
sympathy.</p>

<p>"Sir Travers Clarke has one rule to which he
never permitted an exception: that it is the
fighting man who has to be considered first and
last. In France he was quite willing that the
Staff should labour to the extreme point of
endurance to take any of the load off the man in
the trenches. He did not like about him men,
however clever, who had not seen fighting. It
was the first duty of the Staff, he insisted, to
enter with the completest sympathy into the
feelings and the difficulties of the fighting man.
'Bad Staff work mostly arises from not knowing
the differences between an office and a trench,'
was one of his aphorisms."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This is not a history of the war; nor a
contribution to any of the numerous war
controversies; it is merely a sketch of life at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
G.H.Q. as it appeared to a Staff Officer; but
I cannot help obtruding a reply to some current
criticisms of Lord Haig: that he was too
inclined to stand by his officers, that he was
reluctant to "butcher" a man, and that in
consequence he did not get the highest standard
of efficiency. Faithfulness to his friends and
servants was certainly a marked characteristic
of Lord Haig as Commander-in-Chief. He
chose his men cautiously and, I believe, with
brilliant insight. Having chosen them he stood
by them faithfully in spite of press or political
or service thunderings, unless he was convinced
that they were not equal to their work.</p>

<p>It is a characteristic which, even allowing
that there was an odd case of over-indulgence,
of giving a man a little too much benefit of the
doubt, worked on the whole for the good. Men
do not do their best work with ropes round their
necks; and I believe that a great newspaper
magnate whose motto at first was "Sack, Sack,
Sack," very soon found out that it was a
mistake.</p>

<p>In this particular instance I suppose the
Commander-in-Chief had powerful urging
often enough to "butcher" his Q.M.G., who
did things of so disturbing a character. He
did not; and the event proved him right, as it
did in practically every one of his great trusts
during the war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Reorganisation of Supply and Transport
filled the attention of G.H.Q. during the early
months of 1918. Over a curiously wide range
of subjects swept a wave of reform and
retrenchment. As I have already told, there
was a definite organisation to collect the salvage
of the battlefields, an organisation which saved
millions of money in rags, bottles, waste-paper,
swill, bones and grease as well as in the more
obvious matters of shell-cases and derelict arms
and ammunition. An Agricultural Directorate
was set to work to grow potatoes and oats and
vegetables and other food stuffs behind the lines.
Rations were judiciously reduced, a substantial
difference being left in favour of the man in
the actual fighting line as compared with the
man at the Base. The supply of certain
luxuries at the E.F. canteens was stopped or
limited, but it was provided that the man in the
fighting line should suffer less from this than
the man at the Base. Weekly conferences were
instituted to discuss the most economical use of
labour, of material and of plant. Every matter
great and small had searching attention, and
the British Army began to be run like an up-to-date
competitive business. Some of the
injudicious laughed. They christened the
General in charge of Salvage "O.C. Swills"
and "Rags and Bones." They could not
"see" a Colonel whose mission in life was to
cut down laundry costs and arrange for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
darning of the men's socks when they came out
of the wash.</p>

<p>But all these things had to do with the
winning of the war. It is a fact that if the
lavishness of 1914-15-16-17 had been carried
into 1918 we could not have won the war,
because we should have been bankrupt of
material.</p>

<p>G.H.Q. at the dawn of the Spring of 1918
was very serious in mind, but not so much so as
to fail to get some amusement as well as interest
out of the various new ideas in military
administration; and fully confident now that
the people at Home were going to stick it out.
In this connection there was often mentioned
with cheerfulness a London bye-election towards
the end of 1917 for an area which had had
special attention from the German air-raids.
Some rather expected to see a candidate come
forward from among the little group known as
"Pacifists," who would seek votes on the plea
that the best way to stop air-raids quickly and
to get out of the discomforts of the war would
be to meet half-way the proposals of the
Germans who were trying for an inconclusive
peace.</p>

<p>What actually happened was quite different.
A candidate came forward under the banner of
the Government, pledged to the Government's
programme of carrying on the war until German
militarism was crushed and Germany made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
reparation for the ruin she had wrought in
Europe. This candidate had the support of
both the old political parties. Against him
there came out another candidate. Did this
candidate seek to win votes by pleading
for a friendly consideration of Germany's
hypocritical peace proposals? He did not.
From what one could gather of the feeling of
the electorate, if he had done so he would have
been ducked in the nearest pond. No, his
appeal was based on the plea that the Government
candidate did not go far enough in
hostility to Germany, and that that gentleman
was not fully in favour of carrying to German
homes the dastardly air-war which Germany
waged on a civilian population.</p>

<p>Then a third candidate appeared on the
scene. He was not for any half-hearted policy.
His cry to the electors was that neither of the
other two candidates was sufficiently earnest in
regard to the war against Germany. His
programme was of one clause only, the necessity
of bombing Germany out of her barbarism.
He did not believe that any method of sweet
reasonableness was of any use. A thousand
tons of bombs daily on Berlin, and a ration in
proportionate scale on other German towns, was
his idea.</p>

<p>Women speakers came to take part in the
contest. Did they advocate making concessions
to the German desire to sneak away from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
consequences of the crime of 1914? They did
not. They were more vigorous than any of the
men speakers in demanding a full measure of
reprisal on Germany. No one throughout the
whole contest whispered "peace."</p>

<p>It was altogether inspiriting. Here was a
chance to see what the people of England, the
people who stood behind the Army and the
Navy and were our ultimate supports, felt about
the war. We could see that they were utterly
resolute, with not a sign of weariness, nor of
fear, nor of tolerance for a craven peace. Their
message was "Fight on, Fight on. Bring us
home a real peace. We will put up with
everything the Boche can do; we will carry on.
But no palter, no surrender. Finish the job
you are at."</p>

<p>The English people terrorised? Not a bit of
it. They were only getting their blood up.
And G.H.Q. saw that and was comforted.</p>

<p>There was also a good deal of solid comfort
in the way that London took the bitter
experience of "rations." We never had any
food scarcity in the Army and, going on leave,
officer or soldier had a food card that guaranteed
him a good holiday supply. So we were in the
best position to appreciate the cheerful way in
which Great Britain took the very thin gruel of
ration times. Every officer coming back from
leave expressed his glowing admiration of
civilian patience.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>Those German agents in London who relieved
the tedium of the war for the Allies by reporting
to Berlin such "happenings" as the Battle of
Oxford Street and the destruction of whole
quarters of London by air attacks, set out, for the
fooling of the German public, some fine accounts
of dismay and discontent caused by food tickets.
But as a matter of truth, London on rations
surprised and gratified the most cheerful
optimists. The old city "took her medicine"
not only with patience but with an actual
gaiety.</p>

<p>To sum up: between the close of the fighting
season of 1917 and the beginning of that of 1918,
G.H.Q. was at first a little depressed at the
thought that political developments would
prevent the Army from seeing the job through
in a satisfactory way; was subsequently
reassured as to the feeling of the civilian
population; and thereafter faced the future
with complete confidence.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h4>ENTER THE AMERICANS.</h4>

<h4>How the Germans were misled about the
Americans&mdash;Early American fighters&mdash;The
arrivals in May, 1918&mdash;American equipment&mdash;Our
relations with the Americans and what they
thought of us&mdash;The Portuguese.</h4>


<p>There are many claimants for the honour of
being the War Winner. When I was in Italy
in February, 1918, I found a very genuine belief
there that the Italians were the genuine war
winners; that they brought the decisive weight
to bear. Without denying the very useful
effect that Italian neutrality had in the first
stages of the war, and Italian participation at
a later date, I think it would be hard to
convince, say, the French of the soundness of
the Italian claim. The British might be more
inclined to agree; for they still keep up the
curious pose of being a poor feckless people who
never do anything or know anything. Another
claimant for the pride of first place in the
Grand Alliance is Greece; and I believe that
Portugal has some idea of putting in a claim.</p>

<p>But on the whole, taking all the circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
into account and reckoning not war services only
but war effect, the actual final blow to the
Germans' hopes was delivered when the United
States of America declared war. It was when
Germany made that declaration necessary, in
spite of the sincere wish of the Americans to
keep out of the war, that all hope vanished of
Germany securing an arranged peace. From
that moment it was clear that ultimately she
would have to take exactly what was handed out
to her at the conclusion of the war.</p>

<p>It is hard to believe that the German leaders
ever seriously believed the stuff and nonsense
that they gave out to comfort their people on
the subject of American participation in the
war. But having blundered by bringing the
United States in they had to try to cover up
their blunders.</p>

<p>German diplomacy was not without successes
of a kind in the preparation and prosecution of
the war. If it is the function of diplomacy to
plot murders and strikes and arsons in neutral
countries, to bribe Oriental despots such as those
of Turkey and Bulgaria into betraying their
people, German diplomacy had a proud record.
But concerning the sentiments and opinions
of honourable communities German diplomacy
showed always an abysmal ignorance. In no
respect was this more clear than in its dealings
with the United States of America.</p>

<p>At first German diplomacy adopted the idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
which was embodied in the German phrase
"those idiotic Yankees"&mdash;the idea that the
United States was a kind of Wild West Show,
whose simpleton rulers could be fooled without
trouble by the intelligent, the super-intelligent,
Germans. When that idea was exploded, the
next to take its place was equally foolish&mdash;that
anyhow the antagonism of the United States did
not matter, for she would not make war, and if
she made war the effort would be so feeble as
not to be worth considering.</p>

<p>Then when the grim shadow of the great
American preparation was already over the
German despotism, and the greatest single
white nation of the world was seen preparing
its mighty strength to the full, the German
people were asked to take comfort from yet
another delusion, that the American nation
would prove to be a "quitter," that it would
be frightened off the field by the German
offensive of the Spring of 1918. The <i>Hamburger
Echo</i> voiced that delusion when it announced:
"It is curious that at this critical moment
American war experts are reported to be
planning an inspection trip of the Front. It
looks as though American capitalists were
growing nervous. The dollar-republic has
stolen ships which ensure her a great Fleet, but
American capital is not unlimited, hence the
liquidation of the war may be contemplated."</p>

<p>How different the truth about that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
"inspection trip" which had the effect,
certainly, of impressing the American Staff
with the extreme seriousness of the campaign,
but led to the result not of "quitting" but of
brigading the American troops temporarily
with those of the Allies. It was an instance
of a sensible sacrifice of national vanity that has
probably no parallel in history&mdash;that decision of
the Americans to allow their soldiers to fight
under British and French flags while they
learned their business.</p>

<p>Unhappy German people to have been fed
by their leaders with such delusions! The
United States a "quitter"! Had any German
read the history of the 18th and 19th
centuries&mdash;heard of Washington, of Hamilton,
of Lincoln? If the German had searched back
only so far as 1861 he would have found that
the nation which he was told might throw up the
sponge at the first hint of hardship and danger,
faced a war which probably, for nerve strain and
call for grim resolution, surpassed even this
great war. The United States had then to
fight not a foreign foe but domestic discord.
It had to set its teeth through a series of great
military disasters. It had to hold firmly to a
forlorn hope, whilst it was faced by the ever-present
prospect of foreign interference. No
nation in modern times has been put to a
harsher test of courage and resolution than the
United States in 1861 and the following year.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
No nation in history showed a more indomitable
courage. And this was the nation that the
German leaders would fain persuade their
people was likely to prove a "quitter!" I
ventured to say at the time that before the
German military despotism was through with
the war it would recognise that the reluctance
of the United States to enter the war would
be matched by the reluctance of the United
States to go out of the war until its purpose
was finally accomplished.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To tell the story of the American participation
in the war does not come within the
province of this work, but some of the facts can
be told of that most dramatic feature of the last
stages of the Great War.</p>

<p>There was a very elaborate and very
successful mystification of the enemy over the
time, the extent, and the equipment of
American arrivals on the Western Front. The
American "Intelligence," in co-operation with
our own and the French Intelligence Branches,
managed to surround these matters with so
much mystery that some of our own high Staff
Officers never knew the exact position, and
strangely over-estimated the strength of the
American Force on the Western Front. There
is good reason to believe that the German High
Command was completely deceived and found
its difficulties increased accordingly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>From almost the first day of the war there
were a few individual Americans fighting for
the Allies. In September, 1914, I encountered
two personally with the British Army, and I
suppose the actual total number was some
hundreds. Later a great many came over with
the Canadian contingents; and there was also
a flying unit, which made a fine reputation for
itself. This began with a small group of
Americans in the Foreign Legion of the French
Army. In the spring of 1915 the formation of
an American squadrilla was decided upon. At
first the French Minister of War was not
inclined to sanction the proposition, but
afterwards decided that no international
law prevented Americans from enlisting
voluntarily, in spite of their country's
neutrality. The squadrilla was to be known
as the "Escadrille Américaine," and to
be commanded by a French captain. On
November 16th, 1916, Colonel
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Barrés'">Barès</ins>,
Chief of the French Aviation at General Headquarters,
decided that the name "Escadrille Américaine"
must be dropped and the official military
number, N124, used in future. The reason
given was that Bernstorff had protested to
Washington "that Americans were fighting on
the French Front, that the French <i>communiqués</i>
contained the name 'Escadrille Américaine,'
and that these volunteer Americans pushed
their brazenness to the point of having a red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Sioux Indian in full war-paint depicted on
their machines." Captain Berthaud, at the
Ministry of War, suggested the adoption of
the name "Escadrille de Volontaires," but
the name finally adopted was "Lafayette
Escadrille." More than 200 American
volunteers entered the Lafayette Escadrille
before America joined in the war. Some
remained in the squadrilla, others were
transferred to various French units, where they
frequently distinguished themselves by the
brilliance of their exploits.</p>

<p>All these troops, however, were strictly
unofficial and of course discountenanced by the
American Government. After the American
declaration of war, American help was confined
for a long time to labour units, forestry and
railway workers. It was not until May, 1918,
that there was any really considerable American
fighting force in France, and not until June,
1918, that it began to have any weight in the
fighting line, and then only as units brigaded
with British and French troops. It was the
usual plan&mdash;a plan made possible by the
admirable and business-like lack of false pride
among the Americans&mdash;to split up their troops
among other troops, allow them thus to be
"blooded," and after experience as platoons,
companies, brigades, to retire to their own
training grounds and form "pukka" Divisions
of their own.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>By April 25th, 1918, there were 12,700
American troops in our lines in France, by May
25th 79,000, by June 25th 188,000. Then the
Second Army Corps was formed and absorbed
95,000 men. The May, 1918, programme
provided for the arrival of six American
Divisions within the British zone of operations,
and there actually were 108,921 American
troops attached to the British Army at the end
of that month. The British Army took
responsibility for the feeding and equipment of
these troops. The system was adopted of
assigning to each American Division as it
arrived a British "mother" Division, to
see it through its early troubles of transport,
equipment, food and accommodation. The system
worked admirably and there was very little
friction in connection with the settling down of
the Americans. Yet the task of adjustment was
not easy. The American troops had to be
equipped with almost everything except
uniforms, badges and caps. The things they
had were almost as much a cause of trouble as
the things they had not. The American troops
had to be gently separated from huge kits of
unnecessary articles at the same time as they
were provided with necessities.</p>

<p>Judging from the mountainous kits of the
American soldiers as they arrived it was thought
that each man carried a roll-top desk, a typewriter,
and a dictagraph in his roll. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
found impossible for the men to march with
their kits, though they were splendid physical
types and full of keenness. I saw one Division
disentrain at a station on Lines of Communication
and begin a march to its camp, a distance
of about ten miles. Before half the distance
had been covered a great proportion of the men
had had to give up their kits to be stored by the
road side.</p>

<p>One American camp was formed at Samer
near Montreuil; and the town's name was
pronounced near enough to "Sammie" to
make it easy to persuade some of the soldiers
that it had been named in their honour.</p>

<p>The Americans at first had a natural love for
their own methods and their own wonderful kit;
but they were very soon convinced of what were
the practical needs of the campaign and came
in time to a whole-hearted admiration of
British methods, which was perhaps the finest
testimonial that G.H.Q. could have had. These
Americans coming from a great business country
confessed quite frankly that the "effete"
Britisher had "got them all beat" on questions
of supply and transport; and they took over our
system in almost every detail.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of the points that arose
will be of interest. The great underclothing
controversy was one of the most amusing. The
British Army had evolved a very practical
system of keeping the troops in clean under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>clothing
without adding to the weight of their
kits. A soldier went up to the trenches or to his
unit wearing a clean suit of underclothes.
On the first opportunity, usually within a week,
the soldier went back (on relief if he were an
infantry man, on roster if he were a special
unit man) to the Baths which were set up in
every Divisional area. Here he stripped for a
hot bath, and whilst he was in the bath his
uniform was cleaned, deprived of any insect
population, and pressed, and his underclothing
was taken away to the laundry. He never saw
that underclothing again but drew a new suit,
or a clean suit, as he went out of the baths;
and so he marched off spruce and smart. The
suit of underclothing he had left behind was
thoroughly disinfected, washed, repaired if
necessary, and went then into the general stock
to be issued again.</p>

<p>At first the Americans could not see that such
a system would work. Their idea was for every
man to carry three suits of underclothing, one
on his body two in his kit. Presumably he
was expected to change in the midst of the
ghastly mud of a Flanders trench. Also
presumably he was expected to carry about his
dirty suits with him, which showed a curious
degree of trust in human nature. It was
objected to the British system that "all men
were not the same size," and in response it was
pointed out that neither were all the suits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
underclothing kept in stock at Divisional Baths,
but that with a fair attention to the law of
averages and a reasonable surplus allowance
no thin man had to go away with a fat man's
suit and no tall man with a short man's. The
British system was finally adopted and won full
American approval.</p>

<p>Boots caused another difficulty. The British
issue was one pair per man; the American, two,
the spare pair being carried in the kit. The
Americans finally agreed that if they could get
for their men boots of British quality (which
was conspicuously better than the American
quality) the one pair issue would suffice.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to praise too highly
the common-sense and civility of the American
<i>liaison</i> officers who had to argue out these points
with our officers. They were never unreasonable,
and were very prompt in crediting our officers
with politeness and good-will. That Americans
and British can get on very well together this
campaign has proved. I think that in every
case where an American and a British Division
were thrown together they parted company with
a marked increase of mutual good-will and
respect.</p>

<p>Optimism was the prevailing fault in the
American organisation. They thought that the
fighting was a much simpler matter than it
actually proved to be. They thought a man
could and would carry an unduly heavy pack.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
They were very optimistic in the matter of
accoutrements and were anxious to use their
own accoutrements when they had a barely
sufficient supply for the strength of a unit, and
no reserve. They were ultimately convinced
that accoutrements in warfare have a way of
disappearing, and without a strong reserve no
item of accoutrement can be kept up. When
there was no reserve of some item, British
accoutrements were substituted. It is a
testimony to the quality of British equipment
that the American troops showed a desire to be
provided with British articles in substitution
for their own, even when the change was not
necessary. British puttees and British breeches
were cases in point.</p>

<p>The American troops got British rations,
except that coffee took the place of tea. One
coffee-grinder per 250 men was provided.
Perhaps civilian England was puzzled over the
fact that in 1918 it was impossible to buy a
coffee-grinder in this country. Now they know
why. They had all been bought up for the
American troops. In all things G.H.Q. did
its very best for the Americans. They had a
fancy for an increased scale of Machine-Guns;
the Machine-Guns were found for them, though
they were a precious and scarce commodity at
the time and we could not give our own
Divisions the increased scale. To provide horse
transport for the Americans we stripped our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Field Artillery of two horses out of every
ammunition team of six. The general principle
was that if the Americans wanted anything it
had to be found somehow and found in a hurry.
Probably we won an undeserved reputation for
slickness in some matters (such as printing
Army publications), for it was the established
rule to give American orders priority.</p>

<p>American <i>liaison</i> officers at G.H.Q. "made
good" with the British Staff very quickly. They
had a downright earnestness of manner which
was very engaging. The American Staff seemed
to have been chosen strictly for efficiency
reasons and, there being no obstacles of
established custom to overcome, the best men got
to the top very quickly. The appointment of
Mr. Frederick Palmer, the famous war correspondent,
to a high post on General Pershing's
Intelligence Staff was an example of their way
of doing things. Colonel Palmer as war
correspondent had seen much of this and of
many other wars. For his particular post he
was an ideal man. But it would be difficult to
imagine him stepping at once into so high a
position in a European Army.</p>

<p>American rank marks were puzzling to
British officers at first. An American <i>liaison</i>
officer obliged me with a mnemonic aid to their
understanding.</p>

<p>"You just reckon that you are out to rob a
hen-roost. Right. You climb up one bar;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
that's a lieutenant. You climb up two bars:
that's a captain. When you get up to the
chickens, that's the colonel" (the colonel's
badge was an eagle on the shoulder-straps).
"Above the chicken there's the stars" (a star
was the badge of a general).</p>

<p>To the same officer I was indebted for a
flattering summing up of British character.</p>

<p>"I don't say you British people are over-polite.
But you are reliable. Go into a
pow-wow and a British officer may strike you
as a bit surly. But if he says he'll do a thing
you can reckon that thing done and no need to
worry. Some other people are very polite; and
they say awfully nicely that they'll do anything
and everything you ask; and six months after
you find nothing has been done."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Americans, when they got into action,
first as auxiliaries of British and French
Divisions, then in their own Army organisation,
were fine fighters. Their splendid physique
made them very deadly in a close tussle, and
they had a business-like efficiency in battle that
did not appeal to the Boche. A favourite
American weapon at close quarters was a shot
gun sawn off short at the barrel. It was of
fearful effect. The enemy had the sublime
impudence to protest against this weapon as
"contrary to the usages of civilised warfare."
This was cool indeed from the folk who made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
us familiar with the murder of civil hostages,
the use of civilians as fire-screens, and the
employment of poison-gas as methods of warfare.
The Americans answered the impudent
protest with peremptory firmness, and kept the
shot gun in use.</p>

<p>It was stated, too, and generally credited,
though this matter did not come within my
personal observation, that the American
Divisions in their sector set up and maintained
a law in regard to Machine-Gun fire. They
did not consider it fair war that a machine-gunner
in an entrenched position should keep
on firing to the very last moment and then
expect to be allowed to surrender peaceably.</p>

<p>The Americans played the game, but they did
not play it on "soft" lines, and the enemy soon
got a very wholesome respect for them. There
was, in the early stages of the American
participation, an evident attempt on the part of
the German Intelligence to encourage an
"atrocity" campaign against the Americans.
German atrocities had a way of casting their
shadows before. A usual method was to accuse
Germany's foes in advance of doing what the
Germans proposed to undertake themselves.
That was the way in which Germany ushered in
her lawless use of prisoners of war in the firing
line, and her enslavement of the civil population
of occupied Belgium and France. When the
German Press engaged in "propaganda"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
work on the subject of the American forces
coming into action, it took the line of
representing the Americans as altogether
despicable and murderous adventurers, who had
come into the war to kill Germans without any
reason whatsoever and when taken prisoners
wondered "that they were not shot on the spot,
as the French had told them they would be."
As one German paper put it: "To the question
why America carries on the war against
Germany they knew no answer. One can feel
for our soldiers who become enraged against this
alien hand which fights against us for no reason.
Our men believe the French fight for glory and
to wipe out the stain of 1870, that Britain
struggles for mastery on the sea and to prove
which of the two giants is the stronger. But
the American! Our field-greys despise him
and do not recognise him as a worthy opponent,
even though he may fight bravely."</p>

<p>But that sort of talk was soon dropped&mdash;as
was the suggestion that American prisoners
should get "special treatment" when
captured. It was rather amusing to watch
from our Intelligence side the man&oelig;uvres of the
well-drilled German Press on the subject of the
Americans. Early in 1918 there was a general
disposition in the German papers to write of
the Americans as tomahawkers and "scalpers"
and so on. Then we learned from our tapping
of German field reports that officers commanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
German units complained that this sort of
propaganda was having such a bad effect on
their men, that they "got the wind up" as
soon as they knew that Americans were in front
of them. As a result a great silence suddenly
fell upon the German papers on this point.</p>

<p>After the Americans had formed their own
Army system we did not hear so much of them
at Montreuil. But they were naturally always
in close touch with G.H.Q., and to the very end
the British Administrative services were able to
give a helping hand to the American allies.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Portuguese contingent remained with the
British Army to the end, and it did very well,
as might have been expected; for as a race the
Portuguese have a proud record of heroism and
knightly adventure. In the Indies, the South
Pacific, and the Americas, Portuguese valour
has left imperishable monuments. The British
Empire in particular owes much to such great
sea captains as the Portuguese Vasco di Gama
(who discovered the sea route to India),
Torres (who discovered and named Australia),
Magellan, Quiros, and Menezes.</p>

<p>We heard much amusing gossip at G.H.Q.
from the soldiers at the Front, who, after a
critical weighing of the facts, arrived at the
conclusion that the Portuguese were "good
sports." That conclusion was not come to
all at once. The British soldier is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
conservative, and he was inclined to be, for
some reason or other, critical of his new allies
at first. In time "Tommy" forgave the
Portuguese for having names "that sounded
like blooming prayers," which was one of his
early reasons for doubt. Here is one incident
that helped to determine a favourable verdict:</p>

<p>A forward post held by the Portuguese was
subjected to a furious bombardment late one
afternoon by the Germans. After a while a
polite note came down from the Portuguese
officer in charge of the sector informing the
British Commander that: "The enemy are
heavily bombarding our position. Accordingly
we have evacuated it."</p>

<p>There was some inclination to criticise; it
was not the withdrawal; the best soldiers on
earth have to withdraw sometimes. But the
polite little note with its "accordingly"
suggested what it was not intended to suggest,
and what was not the fact at all. However,
plans were at once put in hand for artillery
action, preparatory to restoring the position
next morning. But some time after nightfall
those plans were put aside on receipt of another
polite little note:</p>

<p>"The enemy has ceased bombarding our
position. Accordingly we have re-occupied it."</p>

<p>When the full facts of the incident came out
there was a cheer for the Portuguese. It seems
that the officer in charge was a bit of a tactician<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
and knew his men well. The post he had to
hold was very advanced and poorly fortified.
When the enemy began to flood it with shells
he withdrew his garrison to a safe spot that he
had selected, and waited until nightfall. Then,
without any artillery preparation, he led his
men forward and, with the bayonet and those
deadly little daggers that the Portuguese
soldiers carried, restored the position.</p>

<p>An earlier incident of the Portuguese
co-operation was humorous in another way.
"Tommy" had, of course, found a name for
the new arrivals, a name which was more
humorous than respectful. Like all Tommy's
word-coinages it was a good one and spread
into common use. High Authority, fearful
that offence would be given, issued an order, a
very portentous order, which noticed with
reprobation "the habit which had grown
up" of referring to "our noble allies" as
"the &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;." The Order concluded
with the usual warning of disciplinary action.
It was to be circulated secretly by word
of mouth from officer to officer, but some
unfortunate adjutant circulated it in battalion
orders so that all could read&mdash;including the
Portuguese.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h4>THE GERMAN SPRING OF 1918.</h4>

<h4>Was G.H.Q. at fault?&mdash;Where we could best
afford to lose ground&mdash;Refugees complicate the
situation&mdash;Stark resolution of the French&mdash;All the
Pas-de-Calais to be wrecked if necessary&mdash;How our
railways broke down&mdash;Amiens does not fall.</h4>


<p>To affirm that a great German attack was
expected in the Spring of 1918, and that the
site of the attack was not altogether unexpected,
seems to imply a very serious criticism of
G.H.Q. That being so, why did the Germans
succeed in breaking through and winning such
an extent of territory and coming within a
narrow margin of gaining a decisive advantage?</p>

<p>The question is natural, especially as one
soldier in high command has stated&mdash;or is
reported to have stated&mdash;that he knew exactly
the spot where the Germans were going to
attack. Some day there will be an exhaustive
inquiry into all the circumstances of the Spring
of 1918. Probably as a result it will be found
that no serious blame can be attached in any
quarter, but that what happened was the result
of a series of events which were mostly
unavoidable.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>For the first time Germany could concentrate
her whole strength on this Front. Yet our
strength was at the lowest point it had reached
for many months and, since we had just taken
over a new sector of the line, our defence was
thinner on the average than it had ever been
since 1915. Further, we were definitely short
of some essential defence material. If we had
strengthened the sector where the chief attack
came we should have had to weaken another
sector. Then the Germans would have attacked
that sector. They chose, and chose naturally,
the point where our line was thinnest. If it
can be shown that the sector where our line was
thinnest was the sector in which we could best
afford to lose ground, it will have to be admitted
that, in the main, G.H.Q. had made the best
dispositions possible with the means at hand.</p>

<p>A glance at the map of France will show that
pretty clearly. Put in a phrase, the German
plan was to push the British Army into the
sea. In the north our line was dangerously
close to the sea. Our most northern port,
Dunkirk, was actually under shell-fire and in
consequence could be very little used. A very
small gain of territory by the Germans in the
north would have brought Calais and Boulogne
under shell-fire. Then our existence as an
Army north of the Somme would have become
impossible. We could not have kept an
adequate force there in supplies. In the north<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
every yard of territory was of the greatest
strategic value. As our line ran south the
French coast bulged out. We had more room
to man&oelig;uvre there; loss of ground was not so
vital. If the Germans had won on the line
Ypres-Armentières the same depth of territory
that they won on the line Arras-Péronne, we
should have had to evacuate all France north
of the Somme.</p>

<p>In short we took the biggest risk of loss of
ground where the loss was least dangerous to
the vital plan of the campaign. In the light
of the man-power available it was probably the
best course that could have been pursued. We
knew we had to lose ground, probably a good
deal of ground, and decided to lose it where it
mattered least. We had very good ideas as
to where.</p>

<p>For proof of this look up the representations
as to civilian evacuations which were made by
G.H.Q. to the French authorities in February,
1918. Those representations, by the way, were
not given any attention at all in some cases; at
the best only perfunctory attention. The
result was that when the German attack came,
civilian refugees added to our difficulties and
anxieties. If the prompt and complete
evacuation of all civilian refugees from
threatened areas and from areas close behind
the front line, which were urgently needed for
the accommodation of troops, could have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
effected, the Army's tasks would have been
much simplified. But that proved impracticable.
Civilians were generally unwilling to abandon
their homes voluntarily. The French authorities
were reluctant to enforce evacuation. A civilian
quitting his home voluntarily was responsible
for his own keep. A civilian forced to quit
became a charge on the French Civil
Authorities. This naturally led to a wish that
civilians as far as possible should be compelled
to quit their homes by force of circumstances
rather than by order of the authorities.</p>

<p>As far back as February, 1918, pressure was
brought to bear on the French Authorities to
agree to defined measures to meet the emergency
of a withdrawal of part of our line, which was
then foreseen as a probability. But it was not
found possible to secure prompt assent to the
steps which were necessary. There were all
sorts of complications. For one thing it
was feared that to set up the machinery of
evacuation would spread dismay among the
French civilians. Another obstacle was the
financial one which I have already mentioned.
Yet another was that created by the status
of the miners in threatened areas. These
were mobilised men under French Military
Command; their wives and children were
civilians. If their wives and children were
evacuated the miners would not stay.</p>

<p>Later, arrangements were agreed to between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
the British Force and the French Authorities
for the systematic evacuation, with their live
stock and supplies, of civilians in threatened
areas. But the early difficulties considerably
hampered operations. I mention this not at
all by way of a tilt against the French
Authorities, whose reluctance to make provision
for evacuations was natural enough,
but to show that G.H.Q. was not "caught
napping," and to illustrate also the difficulties
which an Expeditionary Force operating in a
friendly country has to meet.</p>

<p>There are, of course, many advantages
springing from the fact that the country in
which you are quartered is friendly. But I
am not sure that the disadvantages are not
almost as great. In an enemy country you
know at any rate where you are; military safety,
military convenience are the supreme law; and
the civilian population have only to be
considered to the degree that the laws of war
and the dictates of humanity decide. In a
friendly country, where the old civil
government remains in operation, an Army is
hampered at many points. There are various
actions which military convenience prompts but
which cannot be taken without the assent of
the civilian authorities; and perhaps cannot be
urged with the weight of the full facts on those
civil authorities. This evacuation difficulty is
an instance in point. If G.H.Q. had had its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
way the Germans would have won far less
material in their advance; and perhaps their
advance would have been stopped at an earlier
stage if our operations had not been hampered
to some extent by the crowding of the road with
civilian refugees.</p>

<p>Still, on the big issues the French were
splendid. What, for example, could have been
more heroic than the decision they came to a
little later: that, in case of the German advance
continuing, the whole of the Pas de Calais
province was to be destroyed, the harbours of
Dunkirk, Calais and Boulogne wrecked, the
dykes and locks destroyed so that the country
would have been generally inundated?</p>

<p>To some degree defensive inundations were
actually carried into effect, but with fresh water
only. The responsibility in the main rested
with the British Army which was holding
the threatened territory. The only saving
stipulation made by the French, who thus
offered in the cause of the alliance to give up
for half a century the use of one of their fairest
provinces, was that before the sea was let in to
devastate the land, Marshal Foch should give
the word. It was on April 12th, 1918, that the
Allied Commander-in-Chief gave orders for
defensive inundations to stop the Germans from
getting to the Dunkirk-Calais region; and on
April 13th the Governor of Dunkirk began to
put these into effect. There were two schemes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
of inundation, one for a modified flooding with
fresh water of certain limited areas; the other
for a general flooding, with sea-water as well
as fresh water, of all low-lying areas around
Calais and Dunkirk.</p>

<p>It is impossible to praise adequately the stark
courage that agreed to this step. It was
courage after the antique model, and it showed
that France was willing to make any sacrifice
rather than allow the wave of German
barbarism to sweep over civilisation. The
effect of letting the sea in on Pas de Calais
and destroying the canal locks and the harbours
would have been to make this great province a
desert for two generations. The effect of
allowing it to fall into German hands, with all
its canal and harbour facilities, would have
been to give new life to the submarine war, to
make the bombardment and ultimately the
invasion of the English coast possible.</p>

<p>At one time it seemed almost certain that an
evacuation of at least part of Pas de Calais
would have to be carried out; and arrangements
were made in detail: that in any area which
was evacuated, either deliberately or in
consequence of direct enemy pressure, the most
thorough destruction should be carried out to
deny to the enemy any stores of material or
facilities of transport. The method of every
destruction and the unit responsible for it were
arranged in advance.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>The main lines of a policy of destruction
were laid down in the event of:&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote><p>1. A withdrawal to the Calais&mdash;St. Omer
  defensive line;</p>

  <p>2. A withdrawal to the line of the Somme;</p>

  <p>3. An enemy advance along the line of the
  Somme, cutting off Flanders and Pas de
  Calais from the South.</p></blockquote>

<p>Provision was made for the using up or
removal of all possible stores; for the destruction
of the remainder; for the destruction of all
railroads, water-ways, signalling systems,
factories, etc. Where British and French
troops were operating together in a fighting
zone, their respective responsibilities were
delimited. Arrangements were also made, in
case of withdrawal, to clear from certain water-ways
all canal craft which might serve the
enemy as bridge material over inundations.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Certainly it was not "gay," as the French
say, this preparation for destroying the
property of an Ally. But we took comfort from
the fact that after all the position was better
than in 1914. Then a German victory seemed
possible. Now in 1918 the only question was
what sacrifices we should yet have to make before
achieving victory. In 1914, after 50 years of
intensive preparation, the German had rushed
upon an unsuspecting Europe. He neglected
nothing in preparing for victory. He threw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
overboard every scruple in order to secure a
rapid triumph, violating the neutrality of
Belgium and Luxemburg merely because by so
doing he gained a better field of deployment.
His objective was Paris, and, according to
authoritative accounts, his plan on reaching
Paris was to divide it up into twelve quarters
and burn down a quarter every day that the
French Army delayed to surrender. The terms
of surrender were to include the giving up of
the French Fleet and the French ports for use in
an invasion of England.</p>

<p>The danger at that time was very real.
Germany was the only country adequately
armed and organised. The British people had
had to sacrifice in great measure the Regular
Army to stay the first German onset. France
was strained to a point which to any other
country would have meant exhaustion. We
could recall the preparations that had to be
made to meet the imminent fear of an invasion
of the British coast; the desperate shifts and
expedients which had to be adopted in the first
stages of the organisation of the New Armies;
the peremptory demands for guns and shells
when there were no factories to make either in
anything like the quantity demanded. That
was a time when it needed the highest of moral
courage to remain calm and confident.</p>

<p>The Spring of 1918 is not a pleasant thing to
think about; but it is hardly endurable, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
now in safe retrospection, to think on the
position of Great Britain at home or in the
field from October, 1914, to September, 1915.
It was that of an unsuspecting man before
whose feet suddenly a pit of destruction opens.
He falls scrambling, struggling down, and at
last reaches a little ledge which gives a
momentary safety. But it is still a desperate
task merely to hang on. Far up, remote almost
as a star, shines safety. Below are his
friends of civilised Europe, all worse situated
than himself, some at the point of complete
destruction. From above a fierce storm of
missiles rains on his head. From below come
piteous appeals for help. To hold on to his little
ledge, to help the friends below, to climb up and
throttle the foe above&mdash;he has all these to do and
little time to think before he acts. Hardly
endurable, yet necessary to think over, so that
the greatness of the danger into which the world
was plunged by German militarism can be
gauged.</p>

<p>In 1914 an occupation of the French Channel
Ports with England almost entirely unarmed
might have been a very serious thing. The
serious view taken of it in Great Britain can
be judged from the preparations which were
made to devastate a great area in the South and
East of England so as to give to the Germans
only a desert as a foothold. In 1918 if the
Germans had got Pas de Calais they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
not have got any ports with it, and an
invading force arriving in England would have
met a force at least equal to it in equipment
and war experience.</p>

<p>So we waited in some confidence for another
Marne to follow another Mons, and smiled a
little grimly at the change of tone in Germany.
The Kaiser, cock-a-whoop again, was declaring
now for a "strong German Peace." In one
office, side by side with the "situation map"
which showed from day to day the depth of the
German advance, there were stuck up in
derision extracts from the most vituperative of
the German press. Here is one from the
<i>Deutsche Zeitung</i>:</p>

    <blockquote><p>"Away with all petty whining over an
    agreement and reconciliation with the
    fetish of peace.... Away with
    the miserable whimpering of those people
    who even now would prevent the righteous
    German hatred of England and sound
    German vengeance. The cry of victory and
    retaliation rages throughout Germany with
    renewed passion."</p></blockquote>

<p>This from <i>Germania</i>:</p>

    <blockquote><p>"There can be no lasting peace and no
    long period of quiet in the world until the
    presumptuous notion that the Anglo-Saxons
    are the chosen people is victorious
    or defeated. We are determined to force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
    with the sword the peace which our
    adversaries did not see fit to confide to
    our honest word. We Germans are an
    incomparably strong nation."</p></blockquote>

<p>These horrible threats remained on the notice-board
until long after the tide of battle turned
and the German was in full retreat back to his
lair.</p>

<p>And we rather liked the story which the
German press had to the effect that a deputation
of German business men had put before
Hindenburg in February the gloomy prospects
of the country's food supplies, concluding:
"In May, Germany will be almost without
food." Hindenburg thereupon replied: "My
reply is that I shall be in Paris on April 1st."</p>

<p>The date chosen seemed so appropriate!</p>

<p>Still, it would be foolish to say that we had no
anxieties. Some of our stoutest fellows were
up at "advanced G.H.Q.," a temporary H.Q.
near Amiens, from which most of the really
exciting work was done. At Montreuil we had
not the exhilarating feeling of being within the
sound of the guns, but had to face perhaps the
hardest of the toil. It was rare for an officer in
some branches to leave his room before midnight,
and the usual hour for starting work was 8.30
a.m. Meals ceased for a time to be convivial
affairs. One rushed to the table, ate, and
rushed back to work.</p>

<p>The work was so overwhelming because of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
combination of circumstances. The character
of the War had changed from stationary to
moving over almost all the British Front,
calling for a return to the mobile system of
supply and for new classes of material. British
reinforcements were arriving from other Fronts,
sometimes without their full supply train and
without the full equipment for our Front, and
not familiar with its system of working. There
were large movements of French troops into
British Areas, and in some cases these French
troops relied upon British sources for some of
their supplies and transport, and in all cases
their line of supply had to be dove-tailed in
with ours. American troops were moved into
British Areas and relied upon British sources
for many items of equipment, transport and
supplies. British Administration was thus
being called upon for supplies to British,
French, American and Portuguese troops, at
the same time as our lines of supply had to be
re-organised and co-ordinated with the new
French lines of supply. Further difficulties
were created by the necessary frequent changes
of railheads and the great movements on
the roads of civilian refugees. Territory
threatened by the enemy had to be evacuated
as far as possible of civilians, and of civilian
goods and stock likely to be of use to the enemy
in case of capture.</p>

<p>The extent of this accumulated difficulty from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
a transport point of view can be gauged from
the fact that a British Army needs on a day of
intense fighting 1,934 tons of supplies of all
kinds <i>per mile of front</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The railways came as nearly as possible to
a complete breakdown under the strain. After
the first Battle of the Somme, our military
railway system in France was thoroughly
reorganised by civilian experts. It was a
reorganisation which followed, I believe, the
best models of the great railway companies of
England, and it coped with the very heavy
traffic during the period of fixed or Trench War
quite well. Unfortunately it was not a system
adapted for moving warfare.</p>

<p>A civilian railway expert would doubtless
find many reasons for amused criticism in a
military railway system in the running. It
would appear to be rather haphazard, to be run
a good deal on the principle of a train getting
there if it could, and to be very faulty in the
matter of time-tables and so on. Well, the
German advance in its brutal practical way
simply riddled with holes that admirable railway
reorganisation which the civilian experts
had conferred on the B.E.F., France.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was only to have been expected.
Trench War in its railway requirements was
deceptively like peace. You had your railway
termini, and the requirements of a Division<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
were fairly stable. You ran so many trains a
day and, except for an occasional rush on some
sector when fighting warmed up suddenly, there
were no problems that differed greatly from
those say of the London, Brighton and South
Coast Railway.</p>

<p>In moving war it is different. Then a railway
system must be elastic enough to stand such a
series of shocks as would be conveyed to the
L.B. and S.C. manager if at 9 p.m. he were
told: "It is Bank Holiday to-morrow. Provide
for carrying 100,000 extra passengers, about
10,000 horses and 4,000 carriages." Then at
10 p.m. he learned: "You can't shunt any
trains at Lewes; and you can only run trains
through with luck. It is under heavy shell-fire."
Then every half-hour subsequently he
got a new order, diverting traffic from one point
to another, changing the destinations of his
trains and so on.</p>

<p>The transport situation for the moment was
saved by the Motor Transport. But the
Commander-in-Chief had to act promptly and
set up a "jury-mast" arrangement for railway
control to tide over the crisis. In effect he took
the supreme control of the railways out of the
hands of the Transportation Directorate and
put it under a "Board of Directors" meeting
daily, at which the Q.M.G. presided. A later
development made the Chief of General Staff
Chairman of this Board. Then, when things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
settled down, the system that had been set up
by the civilian experts was largely scrapped.
Military Railways were again put under the
control of the Quartermaster-General. The
"stupid soldiery" did rather well with them,
not only in the period of pause that came
between the German advance and our great
counter-attack, but in the gigantic task of
following up our advance.</p>

<p>The task of pulling together the railways was
not an easy one. The enemy advance had
caused a direct loss of some light railway
systems, and on the broad-gauge systems
important engine depôts were lost, and our
front lateral line was brought at several points
under the fire of the enemy's artillery. Use of
this front lateral line had thus become
precarious. The results of this were felt in
every part of the railway system. Good
circulation is the essence of railway working;
and a block at any point has an effect similar
to that of an aneurism on a human artery.
Because of the loss of engine depôts, and the
hindrances to circulation on the front lateral
line, the back lateral line along the coast became
seriously congested. This congestion reduced
the capacity of every engine by an average of
15 per cent.</p>

<p>Further, our rear lateral line had two
particularly vulnerable points, one at Etaples,
where it crossed the Canche, and the other at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
Abbéville, where it crossed the Somme. Upon
these points enemy aircraft made frequent
attacks, imposing delays, occasionally causing
minor destruction, always adding to the effects
of the existing congestion. An excellent piece
of work reduced very considerably the effect of
one successful enemy air-raid. Half an hour
after midnight, one night in May, the Canche
railway-bridge at Etaples was damaged. At
once an avoiding line&mdash;constructed for such an
emergency&mdash;was put into operation, and trains
were running through at 2 a.m.</p>

<p>On one of the worst nights of the German
advance, when we went up to the situation-map
without any enthusiasm, half afraid of
what we should see, young Captain Hannibal
Napoleon deepened our gloom by declaring
oracularly:</p>

<p>"If we hold on to Amiens we shall be all
right. If Amiens falls to the Germans it is
goodbye to Montreuil, and no more Paris leave
for a few years."</p>

<p>Hannibal Napoleon (that, of course, was not
his name) was very junior and very confident
of his strategical genius. It was a favourite
amusement to "pull his leg" and draw from
him an "appreciation" of the situation, which
he was always willing to give with the authority
of a Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>This oracle was displeasing, because on the
appearance of things that night we had not an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
earthly chance of holding Amiens. But the
unexpected happened. Not very many hours
afterwards the news came through that a
successful stand was being made in front of
Amiens; and young Hannibal Napoleon was
able to crow like a Gallic cock over his profound
strategical judgment.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<h4>THE MOTOR LORRY THAT WAITED.</h4>

<h4>How a motor lorry waited at the Ecole Militaire
to take away the maps to the Coast&mdash;The Motor
Lorry Reserve&mdash;An "appreciation" of the
position&mdash;Germany lost the War in the first three
months&mdash;Some notes of German blunders.</h4>


<p>One night in the Spring of 1918 a mysterious
motor lorry drew up in the yard of the Ecole
Militaire at Montreuil. Its driver reported
and was ordered to stand by. He stood by all
that night; and in the morning was relieved by
another driver. But the empty lorry still
waited. At night a relief driver came on duty.
But the empty lorry still waited.</p>

<span class="caption">THE ÉCOLE MILITAIRE</span>
</div>

<p>Lorries in those days were precious. Because
the German had seized many of our light
railways, had put under his shell-fire our main
front lateral line and had brought our whole
railway system to a point perilously close to
collapse, the fate of the British Army was to a
great extent dependent on its motor lorries.
By an intuitional stroke of genius, or of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
luck, the new Quartermaster-General had just
brought to completion one of his "gyms"&mdash;the
building up of a G.H.Q. reserve of
motor lorries. There had been all kinds of
explanations of that reserve&mdash;mostly of the
humorous-malicious order. It had been said
that they were intended to carry about the
baggage of the G.H.Q. Generals; that the
reserve had no other reason for being than to
find a soft job for some potentate near to the
golf links of the coast. But whether it was
just a guess or a bit of far-seeing on the part
of Sir Travers Clarke, that G.H.Q. Motor
Lorry Reserve had been built up; and it was
available to rush into the breach when the
railways could not face the task of supply.</p>

<p>Very nobly the Motor Transport&mdash;including
that reserve&mdash;did its duty. There were drivers
who held the wheel for thirty-six hours at a
stretch, and were lifted from their seats
fainting or asleep; a few&mdash;who carried on until
no longer able to see through their bloodshot
and torturing eyes&mdash;ran their cars into trees or
walls or ditches. There were many casualties,
but the situation was saved.</p>

<p>It was just at this time, when a motor lorry
was above rubies in value, that an entirely
healthy, well-preserved example, with driver
attached, was ordered to remain in the yard of
the Ecole Militaire.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>Everyone wanted to know the reason why.
The position was then at its very worst, so the
humourist who surmised that it was "waiting
for the wine orders of the &mdash;&mdash; Mess," for
once found his jape fall flat. The truth was for
a long time known only to a select few. That
motor lorry was told off to carry away the maps
and important papers from Montreuil to the
coast, since the evacuation of the town and of
all France north of the Somme was possible at
an hour's notice.</p>

<p>So critical was the position for some days
that that motor lorry was never off duty night or
day.</p>

<p>But G.H.Q. went about its work unperturbed
to all outward seeming, and there was not a
whisper of losing the war, not even from those
who knew what would be the full consequences
of evacuating Pas de Calais. One officer&mdash;he
would not like his name to be published even
now&mdash;spoke with the most frank recognition of
facts and yet with a robust confidence that was
distinctly comforting:</p>

<p>"If we go behind the Somme it will give the
Germans the Coast from the Canche right up to
the Scheldt for their submarines. That is the
most serious factor. We won't leave them
much in the way of harbour works, of course;
but still they will be able in a year or two to
restore things a bit."</p>

<p>"In a year or two? But will it last...?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh yes, you can give the war another ten
years at least in that event. For there won't be
any American Army to speak of; no port to
land them or supply them from. Our British
Army will have to come down in strength for
the same reason. You can't keep a bigger army
anywhere than you can keep supplied with food
and shells. Look at the ports and the railways.
There will be Havre, Brest, Cherbourg,
Bordeaux as ports of supply and the railways
from them as the channels of supply to the front
line. No good talking of millions of Americans
pouring in. They can't pour. Funnel's too
narrow."</p>

<p>But there wasn't in that officer's mind a hint
of the possibility of failure.</p>

<p>"It's only a question of organising to get at
them. In time weight must tell. The Germans
and their friends are, say, 140,000,000 in
population. The allies who are in the war
against them have 600,000,000 of population
and another 400,000,000 of reserve population
if Japan came in fully, and China, and Brazil.
I count Russia on neither side, but she is still a
liability more than an asset to the Germans.
In money and resources the odds against them
are even greater. I like to go back to the simple
basis of arithmetic sometimes. Of course
weight doesn't tell against skill. But now the
skill is about even. The Germans had their
one and only chance at the beginning, the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
beginning, of the war; because they were ready
and no one else was. They had to win by
Christmas, 1914, or not to win at all."</p>

<p>He went on to sketch vividly the story of the
war up to that date, the very nadir of our
depression. He argued that the enemy had
obviously committed some tremendous blunders.
The Prussian military leaders had been
very clever in securing spectacular victories
(generally after a preliminary corruption of
some weak section of their opponents) and
thus the military position was not easy to see in
its true proportion. But even a surface
consideration must show that whilst Germany
was always announcing victories, she was never
really within sight of victory.</p>

<p>"In the first instance the Prussian Empire
had made no sound reckoning of the forces she
had to meet. That was the first elementary
duty of the strategist. The man who goes out
to fight ten thousand and finds he has to fight
twenty thousand has blundered irreparably.
In 1914 Prussia calculated that Great Britain
would not participate in the war, and would
consent not only to the destruction of France
but to the betrayal of her obligations towards
Belgium. The bewildered dismay with which
Germany learned that Great Britain would not
look upon the treaty with Belgium as a 'scrap
of paper,' the wild hatred toward England
which found one expression in the 'Hymn of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
Hate,' were the screams of a savage creature
caught in a trap.</p>

<p>"She had then one slender chance, a rush
attack on Paris. But the Battle of the Marne
killed that chance. Then the only hope of
saving Germany was to make peace. But she
had made the ghastly blunder of the Belgian
atrocities.</p>

<p>"When a man goes out to fight ten thousand
and finds himself confronted by twenty thousand
it is common prudence to strive to make the
stakes as low as possible, the penalty of failure
as small as possible. There was a chance that,
if that policy had been followed, the war would
have come to an end soon after the Battle of the
Marne, an end not favourable to Prussian ideas
of European domination, giving those ideas a
severe check, but still not wrecking them
irrevocably nor exacting a very heavy penalty.
But the Prussian spirit added blunder to
blunder. Having launched a hopeless war it
set itself to give that war an 'unlimited'
character. Instead of going through Belgium
as a reluctant trespasser, the Prussian army
trampled through as a ravaging devastator in
full blast of frightfulness. By the time
Prussia had fought and lost the Battle of the
Marne she had steeled her enemies to an
inflexible resolution against a compromise
peace."</p>

<p>Prussia, he argued, thus early by two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
blunders of the first magnitude (1) entered into
a campaign against an alliance which ultimately
could command vastly superior forces, and (2)
embittered the conditions of the campaign so
that her withdrawal from it was made
exceedingly difficult. Several blunders of a
lesser order marked the first stages of the
campaign. Belgium having been attacked and
Liége taken, the Prussian army showed a
strange hesitancy and lack of enterprise when
faced by the little Belgian army on the line
Haelen-Tirlemont-Namur. Precious days were
lost in pottering. Whether it was expected
that the Belgian nation would give way after
one defeat, or it was thought that French and
British armies had been pushed up into
Belgium, the German millions were held up an
unduly long time by the Belgian thousands.</p>

<p>At Mons the German Army neither crushed
the French-British force nor pushed it back so
quickly that the main deployment was harassed.
Whether this failure of the German Army was
due to its bad handling or to the excellent
virtues of the French-British force, did not
matter. But the Battle of Mons frustrated the
only hope that was left to Germany at that
time&mdash;a successful rush on Paris opening the
way to a quick peace. It proved that there was
no military genius at the head of the German
invaders. Then the Army which had been
delayed in Belgium was defeated on the Marne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
and had to fall back on the Aisne. The
explanation for this given in some German
quarters was that the Army had outstripped its
big guns and ammunition supplies. That was
as good as any other. No explanation would
clear the Prussian Military Command from the
stigma that it failed when there was that one
remaining desperate chance of success.</p>

<p>And having failed on the Marne and retreated
to the Aisne the German strategic plan lost all
coherency. True, the war was lost so far as
any hope of winning European dominancy was
concerned. But there was still as a possible
objective a peace which would secure Prussia
something in return for the territory which she
had overrun. Such a peace had been made
difficult by the cold rage inspired by Prussian
frightfulness. But it was the only possible
aim left and, from a military point of view, it
could only be pursued in one way, by a definite
hammering at some vital point to secure a
decisive result, with a defensive stand in other
quarters. A defensive campaign in the East
with a determined offensive in the West, or a
defensive on the West with a resolute offensive
on the East.</p>

<p>The Prussian vacillated between the two; his
effort was always shuttlecocking East to West,
West to East, getting a decisive result nowhere.
Like a baited bull in the arena Prussia was
constantly making sensational rushes here and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
there, gratified often by the sight of fleeing foes,
but never breaking out of the arena of doom, and
always losing blood.</p>

<p>"The first three months of the war," he
concluded dogmatically, "were decisive. They
do not redound to the military glory of Prussia.
During those three months the disciplined and
trained devotion of the German troops worked
wonders in the battle line. But indecision at
Headquarters prevented the proper concentration
of their efforts. Prussia had failed to
conquer Europe unprepared. She was afterwards
face to face with the task of conquering
Europe prepared; and her indecision increased.
She was always looking for success in a new
quarter and never finding it. Recklessness and
vacillation and impatience are not sound
military qualities, but they mark the whole
military history of Germany since November,
1914. Recklessness of ultimate consequences
was shown in such matters as the bringing of
poison gas into use. Vacillation was shown
by the effort which was organised to take the
French Channel ports at all costs, and, failing,
was diverted to the Eastern Front, and back
again to this Front, and then again to the
Balkan Front, and back to this Front and then
to the Italian Front and finally back to this
Front. Impatience was shown in the general
failure to push any effort to its logical
conclusion, and in details, such as the haste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
with which poison gas was put into use on a
small and ineffectual scale instead of being kept
in reserve for a great and possibly decisive
effort."</p>

<p>"Take it year by year," this officer
concluded, "it has been always the same.
Germany has added always to the area of
destruction. She has never got nearer to
victory. It will be the same with this Push.
If that motor lorry has to carry away the maps
from Montreuil it may be another ten years
before we beat the Germans, but we will beat
them."</p>

<p>"But if France gives in?"</p>

<p>"France won't give in. Look at her now,
ready to smash up all Pas de Calais&mdash;to blow
up every harbour and canal and road. That
does not look like giving in. Even if she were
forced to it we could go back to our island and
carry on the fight from there."</p>

<p>Then we talked of lighter things.</p>

<p>Going out from dinner my friend reverted to
the war position.</p>

<p>"Anyhow that lorry is not going to take the
maps. I bet you a cigar to nothing."</p>

<p>He was right. Going up to the map room on
the Intelligence side we heard that our troops
were holding in front of Amiens. We had
actually passed the lowest point of our fortunes,
and within a week the motor lorry had gone.</p>

<p>I asked one of the drivers detailed to it, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
either did not know or wisely professed not to
know what he had been kept in waiting for,
what he thought about it all. He replied with
that sound philosophy of the British soldier:</p>

<p>"It was a splendid 'mike,' Sir."</p>

<p>"Mike," it need hardly be explained, is a
trade term in the Army for a soft job.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<h4>THE UNITY OF COMMAND.</h4>

<h4>Was it necessary?&mdash;Was a French Generalissimo
inevitable?&mdash;Our share in the guiding of the last
phase of the campaign&mdash;Points on which the
British had their way.</h4>


<p>The "unity of command" achieved in the
Spring of 1918 caused hardly a ripple of
comment at G.H.Q. Some days after it had
happened we learned that Lord Milner (then
Secretary of State for War) had been over, and
that, with the approval of Lord Haig, Field
Marshal Foch had become Commander-in-Chief
of the Allied Armies.</p>

<p>I suppose that in their secret hearts many
officers felt a little sad that the honour of the
united command had not fallen to a British
General. But there was no question as to the
wisdom of the choice nor as to the wisdom
of the step itself. It was one of the early
misfortunes of the campaign that the British
Government in 1914 had insisted very strongly
on keeping our Army as an absolutely
independent unit in France. The reasons, one
may presume, were political rather than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
strategical; and that there was still some
remnant of the old prejudice against
"continental entanglements." I do not
suppose that if the issue had been left to the
soldiers themselves there would have been any
doubt but that the small auxiliary British
Force would have "reported to" the main
French Army and acted under its direction.
That would have been the natural military
course. But the position became more difficult
as the importance of the British Army grew.
At the time that the united Command was
achieved the British Army was in fighting force
an equal unit to the French.</p>

<p>Two questions are often raised in connection
with this decision of 1918: Was it necessary?
Was it inevitable that the united command
should go to Marshal Foch? Both questions
may be answered with "yes;" though in each
case the "yes" needs to be qualified with some
explanation.</p>

<p><a name="i_0359"></a></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/page_0359.jpg" width="600" height="390" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">AT THE CHIEF'S CHATEAU</span>
</div>

<p>It is, for instance, hardly correct to say that
the decision to unite the command "won the
war;" though it is probably correct that it
hastened the date of victory. Before it was
achieved there was good co-operation, though
not perfect co-operation, between the Allied
Forces. After it was achieved there was
maintained a certain independence of outlook
and of policy on the part of the British
Command which was a great factor in the
speedy consummation of victory. If that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
independence had not been maintained, the
operations of 1918 would, almost certainly, not
have been so gloriously decisive. This aspect
of the final campaign has never been discussed
to my knowledge, yet a knowledge of it is
important if the events of 1918 are to be viewed
in their proper perspective.</p>

<p>I suppose the average "man in the street"
takes the view that early in 1918, the British
Army, which had been blundering along up till
then, was put under French Command and
straightway the war was won. But it was not
at all like that. The British Army command,
whilst giving the most loyal support to the
French Generalissimo and bowing to his
decisions when they were finally made, read it
as its duty still to keep a share in the conduct of
the campaign; and in many most important
conclusions it upheld its own view as against the
French view. The final result in some matters
showed that the British view was the right
view, and that if it had not been taken the
victorious advance would not have been possible.</p>

<p>In an earlier chapter I have given the facts
about the forage ration. It was not exactly a
matter of the first importance, some may say.
But if the French view had been accepted and
the British and American horse ration had come
down to the French level our horse transport
would not have been able to carry on as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
wonderfully as it did from August to November,
1918. As things were, it had nothing to spare
during the last week, as our pursuing troops
can tell. The French with their logical minds
argued that if their horses could do with a
certain ration, ours could. In this case the
apparently logical conclusion was not the sound
one; for it left out of consideration some factors&mdash;as
to whether we did not use our horses more,
and as to whether our men could get, or would
try to get, the same work out of ill-fed horses.
In this matter it was well for the Allied cause
that the British had their way.</p>

<p>In another matter logic threatened to lead to
a step which might have proved disastrous.
The French saw, as the logical corollary of the
united command, a union, a pooling of all the
supply and transport departments. Not only
should the Armies fight under one strategical
direction but they should share and share alike
all their resources. A decision to this effect
was actually come to, the Americans agreeing
with the French view. It was logical without a
shadow of doubt. But British common-sense
recognised that if this radical reorganisation
were attempted in 1918 it would be 1920 before
the Alliance would have been ready for a great
Push. The British Army&mdash;let it be confessed
with appropriate candour and shamefacedness&mdash;was
much more exigent in its demands than
the French. It needed, or thought it needed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
more food, more clothing, more comforts, more
ammunition, more transport. It had evolved
for itself during the campaign a system of
"housekeeping" which was over-liberal,
perhaps, as compared with the French, but
which was mainly a result of the generosity of
the Home people, and was so deeply rooted in
our Army organisation that to have torn it up
in 1918 would have caused all kinds of trouble.</p>

<p>In June, 1918, the "Executive Inter-Allied
Committee on Supply" was formed by an
agreement between the French and the
American governments, to which the British
government at first (apparently) assented. It
was to take over control of all Supply, Storage,
and Transport, and to have executive functions,
<i>i.e.</i>, its decisions would be binding on all the
Armies. The British Command at once saw
that this was impracticable&mdash;that it was
impossible in the very midst of the preparations
for the Great Push to throw into a common pool
so much of the actual equipment of the Army.
The Allied Command was very stubborn in
supporting its plan. But in time British
common-sense proved stronger than abstract
logic, and in July all was made happy by a
decision that the functions of the Board were
to <i>advise</i> on matters of Supply and Storage
and methods of utilising material, as far as
practicable, for the common benefit of the
Allies. The Board, in short, was to have its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
scope in assisting to maintain the excellent
understanding which already existed between
the Armies of the Allies in regard to Supplies
and Services.</p>

<p>The position was not at all that the British
Army wanted to wallow in luxury whilst its
Allies went short, for it was always willing to
help in every possible way; but that its command
knew that the essentially national system of
"housekeeping" which had been set up, could
not be thrown down at an hour's notice without
grave danger.</p>

<p>The same sort of problem was always
cropping up on a smaller scale in areas where
French troops were fighting with the British.
The French had at first a logical aspiration for
an identity of supply systems. Our view was
that when British and French troops were
operating together, it was not possible to serve
both from a common stock, nor by a common
railway service. Ammunition and Supplies
differed in almost every respect, and the systems
of Supply could not be identical. Except in
regard to a few items, one Army could not
supply the other satisfactorily. Therefore,
each Army should have its own depôts,
railheads, and&mdash;for the sorting of supplies&mdash;its
own regulating stations, which would receive
from Base full trains loaded with particular
items of supply and send out to Divisions full
trains loaded with the necessary assortments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
of different items. Something could be done in
the way of pooling bulk stores, such as forage,
coal, and petrol; but for most things there must
be different channels of supply.</p>

<p>British policy was that a British Force in a
French area should provide completely for its
own maintenance, and organise its supply lines
and depôts accordingly. Ultimately it was
recognised on both sides that this was the only
possible policy, and that the trouble of
providing separate regulating stations, separate
railheads, and depôts must be faced. Any
half-way policy was seen to be fraught with
too many possibilities of dangerous failures.</p>

<p>To cite yet one more instance of the British
policy proving the sounder: In July, 1918,
there were very strong indications that the
German power of offensive had passed its zenith
and that the enemy might be forced shortly to a
great withdrawal. There was set on foot in the
British Army at the earliest opportunity an
examination of the measures of Transport and
Supply which would become necessary if the
Germans were forced to withdraw their line.
In 1916-1917 the enemy had been able to avoid,
to a great extent, the consequences of his defeats
on the Somme and the Ancre by retiring his line;
a promptly effective pursuit was hindered by
lack of the necessary material on our part. A
foreseeing preparation would enable a better
harvest of victory to be reaped if the position of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
1916-1917 were reproduced in 1918. We
wanted to be sure of being able to follow up
with about 2,000 tons of supplies per day per
mile of front to carry our troops over the
Hindenburg Line.</p>

<p>There was found to be a divergence of view
as to the best means of following up. The
French were inclined to put their faith chiefly
in light railways. The British idea was that
light railways could be overdone; that there was
not a full appreciation of the modification in
the rôle of the light railway consequent on the
change from trench to moving warfare; that
there was a tendency for light railways to
attempt to duplicate the work of broad-gauge
railways; and a hint of a tendency to look upon
light railways as a substitute for, instead of a
reinforcement of, roads in the forward area.</p>

<p>The British "pursuit policy," to put it
briefly, was to concentrate all available labour
on pushing forward with the broad-gauge
railways and the roads forward from them,
trusting to motor transport and to horse
transport to pick up the burden from broad-gauge
railhead. This was maintained to
be a superior policy to concentrating on light
railways, which could not allow so much
freedom in lines of advance.</p>

<p>The British view prevailed in our sector, and
in the Great Pursuit it proved to be sound.
The Germans were followed up on our sector<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
of the Front in really fine fashion. In the
Somme sector of the Front between August 8th
and September 8th our broad-gauge railheads
were pushed forward an average of 30 miles.
To these new railheads, all kinds of traffic could
go direct from the Base to meet there our Motor
Transport (and, of course, light railways;
these were not neglected but given secondary
importance).</p>

<p>It was at first the French idea to "sandwich"
the various Divisions of the two Armies, to have
a British Division or Corps side by side with a
French wherever possible. This again would
have been a beautifully logical illustration of
the complete identity and fraternity of the two
armies, but it was not business. It multiplied
difficulties of administration, and it was
finally abandoned, much to the advantage of
the common cause.</p>

<p>These matters I cite not with the idea of
deprecating the French General Staff&mdash;there
were presumably as many instances in which
their view was right and ours was wrong&mdash;but
to show that it is not fair to our G.H.Q. to
assume, as many do assume, that the British
High Command had little or nothing to do with
the planning of the great victory. Marshal
Foch is prompt to resent that view when it is
obtruded. He would, without a doubt, agree
that the British were most loyal in service, and
also very independent and stubborn (and often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
prevailing) in council. Probably looking back
upon the great victory which was won under
his <i>bâton</i> he is profoundly grateful that the
British were so forthright in helping to keep
the Allied operations on the best track.</p>

<p>The other question, asked at the beginning
of this chapter, needs to be explained. Was it
inevitable that Marshal Foch should be chosen
as Generalissimo? It is quite certain that no
other choice was possible in view of all the
circumstances. There is no need to come to the
question of who was the more renowned soldier,
or to argue that if Lord Haig had been given
the same chance he would probably have
achieved the same result. Personally I think
that the British Army in 1918 was in respect
of Generalship as in other respects equal to
any in the Field. But that was not the issue.
We were fighting on French soil and had to
demand great sacrifices from the French civilian
population, which a French Generalissimo could
best get. It was quite certain that the British
Army would fight with exactly the same
enthusiasm under a French Generalissimo; it
was not possible to be so certain that the French
Army would under a British Generalissimo.</p>

<p>There was no contested election for the post.
Lord Haig as well as General Pershing
supported Marshal Foch's claims. It was the
work and not the glory of the work which was
the first consideration.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<h4>THE COMING OF VICTORY.</h4>

<h4>The June Position&mdash;German attempts to pinch
out our lines of supplies&mdash;The attacks on hospitals&mdash;The
glorious last 14 weeks&mdash;G.H.Q.'s share.</h4>


<p>By June, 1918, it was fairly evident that the
German attack to drive the British to the sea had
exhausted itself. The enemy had attempted to
push through along the Somme line, separating
the British and the French Armies. Foiled in
that by the stubborn defence in front of Amiens,
he tried a push towards the Channel ports,
which really gave more anxiety at G.H.Q. than
the earlier move, for there we were working on
such a very narrow margin of safety that every
yard lost was a grave peril.</p>

<p>The final effort of the enemy was to pinch us
out of territory which he could not push us out
of, and this effort, though it led to no great
battles, was a very serious menace. During
the month of June there was not a day's respite
from the pertinacious efforts of the enemy to
strangle our arteries of supply. Having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
arrived, at some places, within range of our
front lateral railway line, the enemy sought by
continuous bombardments to stop or at least
hamper traffic, at the same time constantly
attacking with aircraft our rear lateral railway
line at its most sensitive points, the Somme and
the Canche crossings. The ports of entry and
the supply depôts were also repeatedly attacked.
Inconvenience&mdash;serious at times&mdash;and loss
followed from these attacks, but there was
never an actual stoppage of essential traffic.
Provision had been made to prevent any blows
that the enemy was able to deliver being really
effective Alternative avoiding lines took up
promptly the task of broken channels of traffic,
and strenuous work in repair and good
emergency organisation prevented congestion
ever reaching the stage of paralysis. At one
time during this month it was necessary to stop
for a few days all but absolutely essential traffic
from North to South. That was the limit of
the enemy's success, though he was aided in
some degree by an influenza epidemic (which
sadly reduced the supply of labour for railway
and dock work).</p>

<p>One line of German tactics at this time was
rather "over the edge" as Tommy put it.
That was to attack the Base hospitals by
aircraft. One at Etaples was set on fire and
destroyed. There is, I admit, some room for a
shadow of a doubt as to whether the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
deliberately attacked the hospitals or only
accidentally. That shadow of a doubt must be
granted, because it was a fact that several of
our hospitals were near to large railway
junctions and camps, though always clearly
marked and separated from other military
installations. I am not prepared to question
the good faith of those who give the Germans
the benefit of the doubt, though I cannot agree
with them. The attacks on the hospitals came
in June, just when the Germans concentrated
their strategy on trying to cripple our means
of supply. They inflicted grave embarrassment
on our resources, for, at a time when material
was very short and lines of transport fearfully
congested, we had to construct new hospitals
and move patients and staffs. A note made in
July on the point reads:</p>

<p>"Good progress is being made with the
transfer to other areas of hospitals which were
rendered necessary by enemy aircraft attacks.
Though there is very little doubt possible that
the enemy does not intend to respect hospitals,
wherever they may be sited, in his bombing
raids, the precaution is being taken of choosing
new hospital sites well away from any point of
military importance. No hospital will be
established near military camps, important
railway junctions, or bridges."</p>

<p>If it was by a series of accidents that the
Germans succeeded in hitting a number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
hospitals in June, 1918, they were singularly
fruitful accidents for him. The difference,
from a "results" point of view, in bombing a
camp and a hospital is this: if you bomb a camp
you kill a few men but the camp does not move;
if you bomb a hospital you kill a few patients,
nurses, and doctors, and you force the hospital
to move, if it can move, to an apparently safer
place.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In June there was cause for anxiety in
the whole supply position. Seeing that the
existence of the armies depended on maintaining
to the full the huge rate of supply which modern
war demands, and that the enemy was obviously
trying immediately behind our lines the policy
(which was exactly the same as the policy of
his submarine campaign) of pinching out lines
of supply, it was judicious to try to extend the
margin of safety. One way of effecting this
which was explored was to extend "Lines of
Communication" to England, and to keep in
England at places handy for shipment to France
one half the reserve stores of the Army. In
most items the Army worked on a month's
reserve margin. The storing of this month's
reserve in the comparatively narrow strip of
France which we held, subject to constant
bombing, was becoming a matter of extreme
difficulty. The retreat of the Germans began,
however, before any definite steps in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
direction of setting up reserve stores on the
coast of England were taken.</p>

<p>There was no idea that the enemy was going
to collapse so suddenly. G.H.Q. expected to
drive him back to the Hindenburg line in 1918
and to finish him off in 1919. In the middle
of July, 1918, the matter was before the
General Staff with the discussion of plans
founded on the postulate that the Germans
might withdraw to the Hindenburg line, and
that a prompt following up in full force was
intended. An instruction to the Director
General of Transportation asked for facts as to
new railway material that would be needed in
such a contingency. The problem of effective
pursuit, it was recognised, would be largely one
of Supplies and Transport. If our Army could
be brought up to the new German line promptly,
and maintained there with all the means of
vigorous attack, all kinds of pleasant results
might be hoped for. But nobody really was so
optimistic as to think that the enemy would
throw in his hand before the winter. But we
prepared for the best as well as for the worst.</p>

<p>The task of getting ready to put Pas de
Calais in ruins in case of a German advance was
pleasantly interrupted by the now more urgent
task of getting ready to follow up the enemy
with horse, foot, artillery, and with some
scores of thousand of tons of supplies daily.
The fruits of this were reaped in August, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
all agreed that the troops had been well followed
up. Cases of real hardships were very rare.
Some admirably prompt work was done in
railway construction, road restoration, and
canal clearing. One great main road was
opened to traffic two hours after its capture.
Traffic on the Albert line was restored to Corbie
and Heilly the day after capture. The water
supply difficulty was great, and in many cases
water for both men and horses had to be sent up
by motor and pack transport. But on the
territory won our old water bores were found in
most cases intact, and were promptly restored
to usefulness by the R.E. Baths and laundries
followed in close contact with our advancing
troops, and with them in some cases harvesting
machinery to win from waste the crops.</p>

<p>But that, whilst preparing for all possibilities,
we were not such optimists as to
believe in an Autumn victory, is shown by the
fact that arrangements were well in hand to
secure suitable training areas for the British
troops during the Winter, 1918-1919. For the
previous two years, circumstances had not
allowed the British Forces adequate opportunities
for re-training. But, with the
character of the war changing radically, it
was thought necessary that they should have
opportunities to carry out extensive training
programmes in offensive operations of quick
movement during the Winter. Adequate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
man&oelig;uvre areas for each Army close behind its
Front were sought. It is a coincidence that
just after this matter was put in hand military
experts on the enemy side were comforting their
newspapers with arguments that the new style
of Tank attack evolved by the British required
very special training of the infantry, and that it
could not be expected that any large proportion
of the British Army had, or could have, the
necessary training.</p>

<p>G.H.Q., when the critical history of the war
comes to be written, will surely win high praise
for its 1918 work. It took a hard knock in the
early Spring and was faced simultaneously with
the tasks of holding on, of re-organising a
shattered railway system, of training and
equipping reinforcements from America and
from our own distant Fronts, of preparing for
the effective destruction of Pas de Calais,
and of organising new lines of supply in case
a further retreat was inevitable. From these
tasks it had to switch off suddenly to prepare
for a great pursuit instead of a great retreat,
and did so with such skill and care as the result
showed.</p>

<p>How wonderfully, too, the successive blows of
the British Army were timed and driven home!
As Marshal Foch recognised, it needed
supremely good staff work on the part of
the British to control that deadly rhythm.
Beginning on August 8th, 1918, in four days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
the British Army cleared the enemy from the
Amiens Front. That restored our old lateral
line Boulogne-Amiens-Paris and added
enormously to our transport strength. We
could now hit towards the north, and from the
21st to 31st August we fought the last and most
happy battle of the Somme, driving the enemy
to the east of the river. His position then was
attacked concurrently from the north, and by
September 3rd he was back on the Hindenburg
line, and our Army, flushed with victory and its
supply lines working admirably, simply could
not be stopped. The bustled enemy did his
best to make a stand on the Hindenburg line,
and shortened his front so as to allow of a
stronger holding there, leaving to us without a
battle all of Belgium that he had won in the
Spring offensive. But that gave us a new
railway advantage, and on September 18th,
1918, the Battle of Epéhy carried the advanced
posts of the Hindenburg line.</p>

<p>Quickly the home thrust followed. Between
September 27th and October 10th the German
centre was shattered and the rest of the
campaign on our Front was merely a matter of
"mopping up." From August 8th to
November 11th the British Army took 188,700
prisoners and 2,840 guns. (The French,
American and Belgian armies combined took
196,800 prisoners and 3,775 guns during the
same period). When the Armistice was signed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
on November 11th, the British Army was still
full of fight and it had still the means for a
further advance, though its horse transport was
very weary and the men were having a really
hard time in regard to rations and water. But
it is safe to say that it was in better plight than
any of the other armies.</p>

<p>How different November, 1918, from
November, 1914! In 1914 so far as the British
nation at large was concerned it was a time of
desperate shifts and expedients. The lame and
the halt and the blind who had fallen out of the
Regular ranks in olden days had come back to
train recruits for the New Armies. A great
new industry of munition-making was being
founded. It had to make its machines and its
tools before it could make guns and shell. So
far as the Army in the Field was concerned it
held on against heavy odds and with the
scantiest supply of shell to answer the well-supplied
German Artillery. Whilst the
Germans could send a deluge of shells over we
could reply with a bare sprinkle. And we had
our cooks and batmen fighting in the trenches
whilst the Germans were confidently calculating
that the plan of training a new British Army
had been irretrievably compromised by the
heavy losses which the British Regular Army
had suffered, and that a descent on the English
coast with a very small force would be sufficient
to occupy London and end the war.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a legend that the German military
plan from the Battle of Mons to the Battle of
the Marne in 1914 was prejudiced by the
"political" consideration of a desire to crush
the British Army out of existence; that to the
attack upon the British detachment were
devoted forces and energies out of proportion
to its military importance. A part, though not
an essential part, of this legend is the story of
the Kaiser's reference to the "contemptible
little army" of Britain. Perhaps the truth or
otherwise of this legend will be established
when there is a full disclosure of events from the
German side. It is not unreasonable in itself,
for the presence of the Kaiser with the German
Army, and the presence of his sons, without a
doubt interfered often with the military
dispositions of his generals. In an earlier
campaign (that of Napoleon against Russia in
1812) a condition precedent to the ultimate
Russian success was that the Czar Alexander
should leave his army to its commanders, because
he could not act as General-in-Chief himself,
and whilst he was with the Army no one else
could. The German Kaiser's emotional hatred
of the British might well have led to an
unbalanced effort against the British Force.</p>

<p>In 1918 it was not the vanguard of a "contemptible
little Army" that heard the "cease
fire" at Mons. It was an Army 64 Divisions
strong, and in all the fighting from August 8th,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
1918, to November 11th, 1918, those Divisions
had been winning great battles from superior
numbers of German Divisions. At the Battle
of Amiens we had 16 Divisions to the German's
20 Divisions; at the Battle of Bapaume our 23
Divisions faced 35 German Divisions; at the
decisive Battle of Cambrai-St. Quentin our 38
Divisions, with two American Divisions, drove
45 German Divisions out of the Hindenburg
line.</p>

<p>November 11th, 1918, saw the culmination
of a great military achievement. Of the
glory of this achievement the chief share must
go to the British soldier, whose cheerful
and imperturbable courage and individual
intelligence made him a perfect instrument of
warfare; but a large share remains for the
guiding brain of British generalship in the
Field, with its centre at G.H.Q.</p>

<h2><a name="appendix" id="appendix"></a>APPENDIX.</h2>


<p>M. Henri Potez, in a farewell article in
<i>Le Journal de Montreuil</i> (30th March, 1919), paid
the following eloquent tribute to G.H.Q.:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"We know indeed that quite a host of painters,
  coming from beyond the Channel, have sung the
  praises of our familiar surroundings, of our clear and
  happy countryside, of our changing light. Montreuil,
  little by little, was becoming a kind of English
  Barbizon.</p>

  <p>"Then the War broke out. The presence of the
  General Headquarters of our Allies made of Montreuil,
  so to speak, the brain of the British Army. What
  with telegraphic and telephonic lines, and wireless
  telegraphy installations, a whole collection of nervous
  threads radiated from Montreuil, carrying incessantly
  news and orders. For some months we have been one
  of the mysterious centres of the great epic. And the
  silhouette of the Supreme Chief has often been marked
  on our vast horizons. Our heroes have appreciated
  the loyalty and the bravery of our Allies on the
  fields of battle. Side by side the two nations have
  withstood the most terrible trials in defence of the same
  ideal. The two great liberal peoples of the West have
  been the martyrs of Right and of Civilization. At
  the time of the heavy offensives in Artois, we have
  seen the splendid troops, who, having set out full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
  animation and enthusiasm, returned to their camps
  reduced to mere handfuls of men. These are the
  memories that can never be forgotten.</p>

  <p>"Behind the front, the civilian populations have,
  on many occasions, praised the affability of our friends,
  their courtesy and their liberality. War has its
  exigencies; but it must be recognised that they have
  shown the best of goodwill to mitigate them. Their
  kindness on several occasions towards the old people
  and the children, who had flocked here before the
  tempest of war, has often been manifested.</p>

  <p>"Let us not forget, either, in our farewell
  compliments, and our wishes for a safe return, those
  of our Allies who have been represented here by the
  Missions&mdash;Americans, Italians, and Belgians. It is
  more than desirable, it is necessary, that the great
  union of the West should outlast the war. It is
  necessary that the differences and divergencies which
  may be brought about by the settlement of this crisis
  should not be allowed to embitter or envenom; but that
  they should be treated, governed, and regulated with
  moderation, kindness, and a reciprocal generosity.
  In that lies the future of humanity.</p>

  <p>"'You live at Montreuil,' a University man who
  was employed as an Officer Interpreter at Lille,
  recently remarked to me; 'the English speak of it as
  if it were a kind of magnificent country, a dream
  city ... they like its peace, its originality,
  its memories.' Many of those who have lived amongst
  us propose to pay us a return visit. We shall receive
  them cordially. We also hope to see again, in closed
  up ranks, the pacific Army of the olden days, that
  Army which carried easels as its bucklers, and pencils
  and brushes as its lances and halberds."</p>

<h2>The Barber of Putney</h2>

<p class="center">BY</p>

<h3>J. B. MORTON.</h3>

<p>"A faithful image of certain enduring human
characteristics, affection, comradeship, simple endeavour....
Mr. Morton has written with a refreshing
simplicity."&mdash;<i>The Times.</i></p>

<p>"A direct tale, grim, humorous, shrewd by turns,
instinct with right feeling throughout ... art is
also brought to it by Mr. Morton, whose hand is almost
unfailingly sure and sincere."&mdash;<i>The Morning Post.</i></p>

<p>"It is one of the best novels which has been written
about the war."&mdash;<i>The Globe.</i></p>

<p>"There is a simple directness of observation and
description and a quiet breath of feeling about this
story ... that give it a distinction of its own."&mdash;<i>The
Westminster Gazette.</i></p>

<p>"I own that I began <span class="smcap">The Barber of Putney</span> with
much doubt and misgiving. But before I had gone far I
found myself held by a description ... as good
as anything of the kind I have ever seen. Curly, the
'old sweat,' the Mons man, is an excellent portrait.
Tim's adventure with the German sniper, whom he
bayonets, is admirably described.... The
retreat is given in a very vivid and credible way; and
the scenes out of the line and in billets are equally
good.... Mr. Morton has written an excellent
and readable book."&mdash;<i>Land and Water.</i></p>

<p>"A fine piece of work."&mdash;<i>The Birmingham Post</i>.</p>
